Effectiveness of accomodation and constant resistance training on maximal strength and power in trained athletes

Variable vs constant resistace...

Not much evidence, and mostly controversial for variable resistance training

Why variable resistence could be better than constant resistance

The case of the bench press...

Ascending strength curve throughout the ROM for the bench press

Variable resistance could make training more 'even'

What about specificity?

If specificity is taken care of, the other issue is that variable resistance typically causes higher fatigue than constant resistance at similar load

Methods

40 trained males, but only 16 considered in the study??

8 Kung-fu, 8 wrestlers; 20~ year old; 174~ height; 70~ kg; 13% body fat percentage

Metrics before the beggining of the study

1RM on bench press and squat. Fairly vague protocol ('light weight', 'moderate weight', 'heavy weight')

Upper body power by throwing medicine ball

Lower body power using vertical jump test

Training protocol

squat and bench: 3x5@85%

4-weeks, three sessions per week in both group (variable and constant resistance)

Loading in the variable resistance

20% of 1RM was gradually added to the load by chains along the range of motion (every 10' 2.22% of load was added from de 20%)

Execution speed was controlled using a metronome (4s per rep in squat, bench not reported)

Results

Significant difference in lower body maximal strength variable > constant

No difference is weight, body fat, upper body power, lower body power, uper body maximal strength

Discussion

Variable group simply trained harder?

Ways to control this? Force plates perhaps

Units of work

etc.
