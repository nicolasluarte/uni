# homeostasis & fluid compartements

## basic organization of the body
- tissue types
	- muscle
	- nervous
	- connective
	- epithelium
- organ: functional unit
- organ system: several organs acting together

### Fluid compartments
- intra cellular fluid compartement
	- bounded by plasma membrane
	- the largest, 2/3 of the total fluid of the body
	- high potassium K
	- low sodium Na
- extra cellular fluid compartement
	- 1/3 in size
	- High sodium Na
	- Low potassium K
	- Intravascular compartment
		- has proteins
		- 1/12
	- intrastitial fluid space (connecitve tissue)
		- 3/12

### self-regulating mechanisms
- equilibrium
	- equal amount of substance
	- no energy expenditure to maintain
	- no barrier to movements
	- no net transfer of substance or energy
- steady state
	- between extra and intra cellular space
	- constant amount of substance in compartements
	- input = output
	- requires energy to maintain
	- maintain gradient

### what is homeostatis
- central theme of physiology
	- extracellular fluid is the buffer zoneA
	- input/output analogy
- homeostatic control & reflex loops
	- sensor: detect stimulus -> send to integration center (brain) <- contains set points, evaluates incoming signal
	- effector: efferent path -> generates response to maintain normal condition
- high salt diet
	- NaCL -> diet == urine :: neutral balance
	- NaCL -> diet > urine :: positive balance
	- NaCL -> diet == urine :: neutral balance
	- Increased total amount of sodium
	- stays in the ECF; water also goes to the ECF
	- concentration is maintained at a cost
		- vasculature: increased volume of blood (thus, increased pressure)

### general concepts
- interdependent
- maintain internal environment
- homeostatis, balancing input and outputs

	- epithelium is leaky
- ATPase
	- uses energy to move 3 sodium / every 2 potassium entering
	- keep ions at a desequilibrium

# Regulation of homeostasis
- local response
	- cell 1 -> chemical -> cell 2 (becomes activated) :: paracrine control
	- cell 1 -> chemical -> cell 1 (becomes activated) :: autocrine control
	- cell 1 -> physical connection (gap junction, nexus) -> cell 1 (becomes activated) :: gap junction
- endocrine system 
	- endocrine cell -> chemical secreted to bloodstream -> target cell
	- neuron -> synapse (neurotransmitter) -> effector cell
- reflex components
	- stimulus -> sensor -> integration center -> effectors
- external change
	- stimulus::bodytemp=340 -> thermal sensors::peripheral & central -> integration center::hypothalamus (370 signal) -> effector::muscle shivering; vasoconstriction in skin) -> generate heat
	- FEVER, macrophage -> pyrogen -> hypothalamus 40c -> brain interprets body as being cold -> shivering + vasoconstriction in skin

### negative feedback
- removes initializing stimulus

### positive feedback
- increase

### tonic control
- modulatiing the activity of a specfic cell
- hold specific state for longer muscle

### antagonistic control
- parasympathetic
	- slow the heart rate
- sympathetic
	- increase the hear rate

### circadian rhythms
- growth hormone -> released during early sleep
- cortisol -> increases just before waking up
- dictated by sleep/wake, not by light/dark
