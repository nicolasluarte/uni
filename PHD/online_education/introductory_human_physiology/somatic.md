# the somatic nervous system

- somatic: controls skeletal muscle
- autonomic: controls de organs

- with somatic NS, neuron sends axon from the CNS to the skeletal muscle

# spinal cord structure

- interneurons: system that interprets the stimuli coming in 
	- firing of the efferent neurons: sitting in the ventral horn
- motor neuron
	- consists of a motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers it controls
- neuromuscular junction
	- action potential -> open voltage gated calcium ions
	- acetylcholine fuses with membrane and is released 
	- post-synaptic has nicotinic AChR <- acetylcholine sodium channels

# key concepts

- control many types of movements
- a motor neuron and the muscle fibers that it innervates constitute a motor unit
- motor neurons have cell bodies located in grey matter of the ventral horn
- the spinal cord contains interneurons; coordinate and integrate information

# the control of movements

- lower motor neurons
	- muscle spindle: intrafusal fibers
	- alpha: innervates the extrafusal muscle fibers, fibers of the main part of the muscle
	- gamma: innvervate intrafusal fibers; parallel system to alpha, afferent neuron sensing stretch of the muscle
	- alpha and gamma are co-activated
- muscle sensory receptors
	- muscle spindle <- afferent coiled to this sense stretch
	- reciprocal innervation: contraction in agonist, relaxation in antagonistic
		- negative feedback loop
	- golgi tendon organ: tendon attaching muscle to the bone
		- golgi tendon fires when the muscle is stretched
		- max firing at maximal contraction
		- afferent nerve ending
		- mechanoreceptor
	- golgi tendon reflex
		- fixes too much tension in the muscle
		- limits the tension
		- protects the muscle-tendon junction
- central pattern generators
