# the nervous system: introduction and cell types

## neuron
- different parts
	- cell body <- contains nucleus
	- dendrites coming of the cell body
	- axon <- taking information away : when meets cell body is initial segment
- type of glial cells
	- schwann cells: peripheral nervous system
		- support axons of neurons
		- wrap around axon segments
		- electrical insulation
	- oligodendrocytes
		- send several processes
		- myelinates several axons
		- in a way similar job that schwann cell
		- electrical insulation
	- peripheral nervous system
		- schwann
	- central nervous system
		- oligodendrocytes
	- astrocytes
		- support neurons
	- microglial cells
		-immune cells of central nervous system

## membrane potentials

- changes of charges in either side of the membrane
- electrochemical gradient
	- gradient of electrical charged particles
	- set by atp pump
	- outside: Na+ (+) ; inside: K+ (+), more sodium in the outside
	- negative membrane potential
		- more negative charge inside
- equilibrium potential
	- potassium leaves the cell -> more negative inside: negative membrane potential
	- potassium diffuses down chemical concentration
	- inside becomes more negative
	- now electrical gradient is strong and pushes potassium inside
	- when potassium input/output is equal: equilibrium potential for potassium
	- sodium: 60mV
	- potassium: -90mV
. resting membrane potential
	- ATP
		- 3 na+ out; 2 k+ in; negative membrane potential
	- leak channels
		- determine the resting membrane potential
		- more potassium leak channels, less sodium leak channels
- changes in membrane potential
	- polarized: difference in charge (negative)
	- depolarization: less polarized, less negative
	- overshoot: more positive inside, reversal of polarity
	- hyperpolarization: more negative than resting potential
	- repolarizing: becoming more negative but still above resting potential
- graded potential
	- change in membrane dependent in stimulus strength
	- membrane potential decay over distance and time

## how to calculate the equilibrium potential
- membrane potential: voltage difference between the inside and the outside of a cell
	- major mobile ions are K+, Na+ and Cl-
	- affected by the different concentration
	- permeability of the plasma membrane to each ion
	- permeability to K+'is super high in the membrane
		- concentration of K+ will determine the resting memebrane potential
- nernst equation
	- formula that describes how the equilibrium potential for an ion is influenced by its concentration gradient across the plasma membrane

## action potentials
- voltage gated na+ and k+ channels
	- membrane depolarization gates them
	- Na+ fast
		- inactive and closed states
	- K+ slow
		- inactive state
- unidirectional propagation of AP
	- move one way because of the absolute refractory period of the voltage gates na+ channel

## integration of signals
- dendrites: ligand gates ion channels, graded potentials
- cell body (soma): ligand gated ion channels; graded potentials
- axon: voltage gated channels, lowest threshold for initiating an action potential, "integrative zone"

## saltatory conduction
- large diameter, myelinated axons transmit action potential very rapidly
- voltage gated channels are concentrated at the nodes
- inactivation of voltage gated na+ channels insures uni-directional propagation along the axon	

# the nervous system methods of communications

## chemical synapse
- action potential goes down the axon
	- at end of axon -> voltage gates Ca2+ channels
	- calcium enter the axon terminus -> acts as a signal to vesicles to fuse with the plasma membrane
	- neurotransmiters into the synaptic cleft
- can do re-uptake or degrade neurotransmiter

## excitatory and inhibitory synapses
- EPSP -> graded depolarization due to influx of positive ions
- IPSP -> graded hyperpolarization due to net influx of negative ions, efflux of positive ions

## neuronal netwoks
- divergent -> one neuron can control to multiple secondary neurons
- convergent -> multiple neurons control a single secondary neuron
- lateral inhibition
	- inhibiting their neighbours

## cholinergic synapses
- acetylcholine (ACh) <- neurotransmiter
	- two type of receptors
		- nicotinic-ligand gated ion channel
			- skeletal muscle and brain
		- muscarinic-G protein coupled
			- heart, smooth muscle, glands, brain

## adrenergic synapses (tyrosine based)
	- catecholamines
		- norepinephrine
		- epinephrine
	- receptor g-protein coupled
		- alpha
		- beta

# the nervous system organization
- peripheral nervous system <- afferent portion <- inputs
- efferent <- output to muscle or to do an action, cause the response
- CNS
	- somatic
		- efferent
	- autonomic
		- efferent
		- enteric
		- parasympathetic
		- sympathetic

## pns output
- somatic 
	- single neuron out to the muscle -> acetylcholine
		- bind to nicotinic AChR 
- autonomic
	- two neurons in series
- parasympathetic NS
	- first neuron acetylcholine + nicotinic R
	- second neuron acetylcholine + muscarininc R
- sympathetic
	- first neuron
		- acetylcholine + nicotinic R
	- second neuron
		- norepinephrine + adrenergic R
- sympathetic
	- synpasis with adrenal gland 
		- release epinephrine to blood + bind to adrenergic receptors
