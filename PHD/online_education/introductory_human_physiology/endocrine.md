# endocrine system general concepts

## homeostatic control
- local response
	- occurs at target cells
		- paracrine/autocrine not considered hormones
		- hormone is considered when is released into the blood
- reflexes
	- response made is distant from target cell
	- low concentration / high affinity
	- in contrast, the nervous system, works with high concentration. Receptor with low affinity
	- high concentration / low affinity

## endocrine glands
- ductless glands
- specific homeostatic mission:
	- sodium/water
	- calcium
	- energy
	- cope with stress
	- growth
	- reproduction

## concentration of hormone in blood
- rate of production
	- most regulated
	- mediated by + and - feedback
- rate of delivery
	- dependent on perfusion and blood flow
	- follow mass action laws (carriers)
		- lipids and steroid bind to protein carrier, carriers have low affinity
			- H * C -> H + C -> H * R
- rate of degradation and/or excretion

## peptide protein hormones
- peptide 3+ aminos
	- made in rough endoplasmic reticulum
		- preprohormone
			- inactive
			- packaged and moved to the golgi
			- cleaved to prohormone
		- prohormone
			- almost always inactive
			- secretory vesicle
		- hormone
			- active
			- happens within the secretory vesicle
			- delivered via +calcium Ca or cyclic AMP (adenosin monophosphate) signal
			- prepackaged, released as needed
			- once they are in the blood, the half life is short
			- do not require carriers, because they are soluble
- steroid hormones
	- adrenal, gonads, placenta
	- not soluble in plasma, lipid plasma
	- use carriers, because they are soluble in lipid
	- synthesized on demand
	- concerted to active in target tissues
	- testosterone -> DHT ; testosterone -> estrogen, depending upon the target
- amino acid derivatives
	- insoluble in plasma
	- transported via carrier
	- long half life
	- conversion in target tissues

## transport carriers
- extend live of the hormone
- sequester the hormone from its target cell receptor

## receptor types
- soluble in plasma:: hydrophilic, receptor in the cell surface
	- integral membrane proteins
		- tyrosine kinase (puts phosphate) <- growth hormone -> when binded, then second msgr start the chain
		- inherent tyrosine kinase <- insulin -> phosphorilation
		- g protein coupled <- glucagon
		- steroid & thyroid hormone, can cross plasma membrane -> nuclear receptor -> changes to DNA

## target cell sensitivity
- affinity
- receptor number
- competition
- saturation

## types of stimuli
- Stimuli -> neuron (sense sodium concentration) -> secrete hormone -> anti diuretic hormone -> kidney -> dilutes sodium concentration :: neural control
- hormonal control
- low blood calcium -> paratyroid -> paratyroid hormone -> bone -> release calcium :: substrate control

## inactivation of hormone signaling
- receptor desensitization ex: type II diabetes
	- sequestration
		- remove the receptor from the surface
	- degradation
		- destroy receptor
- negative feedback
	- removes initial stimulus

## general concepts
- peptide hormones are soluble in plasma, bind cell surface receptor, are fast-acting and are short-lived
- thyroid hormones and steroid hormones are insoluble in plasma, act via intracellular receptor to change transcription, are slow acting and long lived
- binding proteins (carriers) regulate hormone availability, physiologic function, and half lives
- hormone release is under neural, hormonal, nutrient and ion regulation
- signaling is regulated by changing plasma hormone concentration and by changing target cell receptor sensitivity

# Endocrine system assessment & pathology

## assessment of function
- too much -> hyper secretion, hormone excess
- too little -> hypo-secretion, hormone insufficiency
- target cell resistance -> unresponsive
- just right -> normal or eu-secretion, works fine

## competitive binding assay
- high sensitivity and high specificity
- specific antibody -> marks the hormone -> labeled hormone
	- unlabeled hormone competes, then via subtraction we find how much unlabeled hormone there was, because we know the initial labeled hormone concentration

## bioassay = function?
- low plasma glucose -> hypothalamus -> CRH (cortico trophin) -> anterior pituitary -> ACTH (adreno cortico throphin) -> adrenal cortex -> cortisol -> negative feedback anterior pituitary + hypothalamus
- if high cortisol -> high plasma glucose -> give dexamethasone to inhibit ACTH -> ACTH lvl should fall -> - cortisol; if not -> problem with the adrenal gland
- low plasma + low cortisol -> give ACTH -> cortisol should rise -> problem was with hypothalamus or anterior pituitary

## general concepts
- pathology happens when theres too much or too little hormone or resistance to the hormone due to receptor dysfunction
- interpretation of hormone levels requires consideration of either the trophic hormone or of the ios/nutrient controlled by the hormone
