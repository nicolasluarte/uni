# the senses

## general  principles

- sensation -> sensory information that reaches the brain; action potential frequency, more neurons stimulated
- perception -> how we interpret the sensation
- adaptation -> decrease in sensitivity, decreased aciton potential frequency with the same stimulus, some systems are more sensitive to adaptation

## PNS sensory input

- sitting on ganglia, outside the central nervous system
- dorsal side of the spinal cord
- pseudo unipolar neuron, one long axon with the body in the middle

## somatosensation

- touch and pressure -> mechanoreceptor in encapsulated and free nerve endings
- propioception -> muscle stretch receptors, mechanoreceptors in skin, joints, tendons, ligamente, vision, vestibular system
- temperature -> different types of thermoreceptors (ion channels activated at certain temps), also respond to menthol, capsaicin, ethanol
- pain -> free nerve ending expressing nociceptor, sense mechanical deformation, chemicals released by damaged cells or immune cells

## visual system

1. light enter the eye and is focused by a lens on to the retina
2. retinal photoreceptor transduce light energy into electrical signal
3. processing of the electrical signal through neural pathways

## the eye

- cornea
	- most of the focusing of the light
- pupil
	- light travels through
- lens 
	- fine focus near/far
	- changes shape
	- contracts/relaxes <- ciliary muscles connected by zonular fibers
	- contracted = less tension, more rounded lens (focus on near object)
	- relaxed = more tension, more flattened lens (focus on distant object)
- phototransduction
	- light hit photoreceptors 
	- g protein coupled receptor <- binded to retinal (vitamin A)
	- retinal changes conformation when hit by photon
	- start signal transduction cascade
		- decrease in cyclic GMP
			- GMP-gated cation channel closes
			- at rest photoreceptor cell is depolarized
	- action potential <- graded potential <- ganglion
	- 3 color sensing cones RGB + rhodopsin
- retina
	- contains the photoreceptors cells
