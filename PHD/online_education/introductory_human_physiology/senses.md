# the senses

## general  principles

- sensation -> sensory information that reaches the brain; action potential frequency, more neurons stimulated
- perception -> how we interpret the sensation
- adaptation -> decrease in sensitivity, decreased aciton potential frequency with the same stimulus, some systems are more sensitive to adaptation

## PNS sensory input

- sitting on ganglia, outside the central nervous system
- dorsal side of the spinal cord
- pseudo unipolar neuron, one long axon with the body in the middle

## somatosensation

- touch and pressure -> mechanoreceptor in encapsulated and free nerve endings
- propioception -> muscle stretch receptors, mechanoreceptors in skin, joints, tendons, ligamente, vision, vestibular system
- temperature -> different types of thermoreceptors (ion channels activated at certain temps), also respond to menthol, capsaicin, ethanol
- pain -> free nerve ending expressing nociceptor, sense mechanical deformation, chemicals released by damaged cells or immune cells

## visual system

1. light enter the eye and is focused by a lens on to the retina
2. retinal photoreceptor transduce light energy into electrical signal
3. processing of the electrical signal through neural pathways

## the eye

- cornea
	- most of the focusing of the light
- pupil
	- light travels through
- lens 
	- fine focus near/far
	- changes shape
	- contracts/relaxes <- ciliary muscles connected by zonular fibers
	- contracted = less tension, more rounded lens (focus on near object)
	- relaxed = more tension, more flattened lens (focus on distant object)
- phototransduction
	- light hit photoreceptors 
	- g protein coupled receptor <- binded to retinal (vitamin A)
	- retinal changes conformation when hit by photon
	- start signal transduction cascade
		- decrease in cyclic GMP
			- GMP-gated cation channel closes
			- at rest photoreceptor cell is depolarized
	- action potential <- graded potential <- ganglion
	- 3 color sensing cones RGB + rhodopsin
- retina
	- contains the photoreceptors cells

# Hearing and the vestibular system

## auditory system

- detects sound waves compression and expansion of air molecules in the form of pressure waves
- amplitude of the wave determines volume
- frequency determines de pitch

- anatomy of the ear
- malleus, incus, stape <- transduce to liquid in the cochlea
	- amplification of air vibrations
- cause vibrations on the oval windows of the cochlea
- fluid paths
	- oval windows
		- scala vestibuli
		- scala timpani
	- round window
	- organ of corti
		- scala vestibuli: fluid right behind oval window
		- scala tympani, above basilar membrane
			- hair cells <- tectorial membrane
			- bending of hair cause hyper or depolarization

## vestibular system

- angular accelarion
- linear acceleration
- semicircular canals: changes in head rotation
- otolith organs
	- involve hair cells
	- linear or position of the head
- semicircular canal <- 3 channels at 90Â° angles
	- cupula <- hair cells that have extensions
- utricle
	- detect movement on the horizontal
- saccule
	- detect vertical movement


## chemical senses

- taste
	- taste pore
	- taste receptor cell
	- afferent nerve
	- modalities <- increase in intracellular Ca++ 
		- sweet <- gprotein
		- sour <- ion channels (H+)
		- salt <- ion channels (Na+)
		- bitter <- gprotein
		- umami <- gprotein
- smell
	- primary afferent neurons themselves, express olfactory receptors
	- neurons send out cillia
	- have receptor that bind odorant
	- gprotein coupled receptor
	- 400~ olfactory receptor types
	- can discriminate 10.000 odors
	- creates graded potentials -> leads to action potentials
	- combinatorial perception
