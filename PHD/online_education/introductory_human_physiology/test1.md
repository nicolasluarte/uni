# homeostasis & fluid compartements

## basic organization of the body
- tissue types
	- muscle
	- nervous
	- connective
	- epithelium
- organ: functional unit
- organ system: several organs acting together

### Fluid compartments
- intra cellular fluid compartement
	- bounded by plasma membrane
	- the largest, 2/3 of the total fluid of the body
	- high potassium K
	- low sodium Na
- extra cellular fluid compartement
	- 1/3 in size
	- High sodium Na
	- Low potassium K
	- Intravascular compartment
		- has proteins
		- 1/12
	- intrastitial fluid space (connecitve tissue)
		- 3/12

### self-regulating mechanisms
- equilibrium
	- equal amount of substance
	- no energy expenditure to maintain
	- no barrier to movements
	- no net transfer of substance or energy
- steady state
	- between extra and intra cellular space
	- constant amount of substance in compartements
	- input = output
	- requires energy to maintain
	- maintain gradient

### what is homeostatis
- central theme of physiology
	- extracellular fluid is the buffer zoneA
	- input/output analogy
- homeostatic control & reflex loops
	- sensor: detect stimulus -> send to integration center (brain) <- contains set points, evaluates incoming signal
	- effector: efferent path -> generates response to maintain normal condition
- high salt diet
	- NaCL -> diet == urine :: neutral balance
	- NaCL -> diet > urine :: positive balance
	- NaCL -> diet == urine :: neutral balance
	- Increased total amount of sodium
	- stays in the ECF; water also goes to the ECF
	- concentration is maintained at a cost
		- vasculature: increased volume of blood (thus, increased pressure)

### general concepts
- interdependent
- maintain internal environment
- homeostatis, balancing input and outputs

	- epithelium is leaky
- ATPase
	- uses energy to move 3 sodium / every 2 potassium entering
	- keep ions at a desequilibrium

# Regulation of homeostasis
- local response
	- cell 1 -> chemical -> cell 2 (becomes activated) :: paracrine control
	- cell 1 -> chemical -> cell 1 (becomes activated) :: autocrine control
	- cell 1 -> physical connection (gap junction, nexus) -> cell 1 (becomes activated) :: gap junction
- endocrine system 
	- endocrine cell -> chemical secreted to bloodstream -> target cell
	- neuron -> synapse (neurotransmitter) -> effector cell
- reflex components
	- stimulus -> sensor -> integration center -> effectors
- external change
	- stimulus::bodytemp=340 -> thermal sensors::peripheral & central -> integration center::hypothalamus (370 signal) -> effector::muscle shivering; vasoconstriction in skin) -> generate heat
	- FEVER, macrophage -> pyrogen -> hypothalamus 40c -> brain interprets body as being cold -> shivering + vasoconstriction in skin

### negative feedback
- removes initializing stimulus

### positive feedback
- increase

### tonic control
- modulatiing the activity of a specfic cell
- hold specific state for longer muscle

### antagonistic control
- parasympathetic
	- slow the heart rate
- sympathetic
	- increase the hear rate

### circadian rhythms
- growth hormone -> released during early sleep
- cortisol -> increases just before waking up
- dictated by sleep/wake, not by light/dark

# transporters pumps & channels

## simple diffusion & gap junctions
- flux: random movement of molecules across a surface per unit time
	- simple diffusion
- gap junctions: permits diffusion of ions between coupled cells

### characteristic of simple diffusion
- from high to low concentration
- no energy
- rapidly over short distance, slow over long distances
- continues until equilibrium is reached
- directly related to temperature
- inversely related to the size of the molecule
- is dependent on the total surface area and thickness of the membrane barrier

### facilitated diffusion
 - not lipo-soluble, charged molecules, can't move through the plasma membrane through simple diffusion
 - integral membrane protein
 	- can change conformation to external or internal cellular space
	- glucose transporters -> net flux determined by gradient
![Flux: simple vs facilitated](/home/nicoluarte/flux.png)
- co-transporters
	- move more than one solute at any time
	- symporter -> move in same direction
	- antiporter -> move in different directions
- channels
	- aquaporine -> move water across the membrane
	- regulated opening is called gating
		- if opened movement is due to diffusion
	- gating of channels
		- ligand gating
			-requires binding of specific chemical to open
		- voltage
			- requires specific gradient of electrical charge
		- mechanical
			- requires specific tension to open
- pump mediate active transport
	- pumps actively moves solute against concentration gradient
	- pumps are ezyme, cleave atp -> undergo different conformation
- transcellular transport
	- movement across the cell into the bloodstream
	- secondary active transport
		- transporter in the basal and apical side
		- glucose transported by the sodium Na+ gradient, 'free ride'
- general concepts
	- movement across the bi lipid layer is dependent in size, charge and solubility
	- net flux determined by gradient
	- permeable solute crosses the membrane by simple diffusion, moving down its concentration gradient
	- a non-permeable solute cross the membrane by facilitated diffusion, requires gradient, specific, and its saturable
	- primary active transport moves a solute against its concentration gradient, requires ATP, specific, and is saturable
	- secondary active transport couples the activity of a co-transporter with a pump. This is used for transcellular transport of a solute.

# effective solutes & water transport
- concentration of water
	- osmosis
		- change in compartment size when membrane is impermeable to solute
		- occurs by diffusion only
		- uses aquaporin channels
		- has highest concentration when pure water
- important terms
	- molarity:  mole/vol (1 mole = 6 x 10^23 molecules)
	- osmolarity: (#molecule/vol) * (# particles/molecule)
	- osmolality: kg of water
- tonicity & cell volume
	- always comparative
	- # non-penetrating molecules/volume
- changes in body fluid compartements
# endocrine system general concepts

## homeostatic control
- local response
	- occurs at target cells
		- paracrine/autocrine not considered hormones
		- hormone is considered when is released into the blood
- reflexes
	- response made is distant from target cell
	- low concentration / high affinity
	- in contrast, the nervous system, works with high concentration. Receptor with low affinity
	- high concentration / low affinity

## endocrine glands
- ductless glands
- specific homeostatic mission:
	- sodium/water
	- calcium
	- energy
	- cope with stress
	- growth
	- reproduction

## concentration of hormone in blood
- rate of production
	- most regulated
	- mediated by + and - feedback
- rate of delivery
	- dependent on perfusion and blood flow
	- follow mass action laws (carriers)
		- lipids and steroid bind to protein carrier, carriers have low affinity
			- H * C -> H + C -> H * R
- rate of degradation and/or excretion

## peptide protein hormones
- peptide 3+ aminos
	- made in rough endoplasmic reticulum
		- preprohormone
			- inactive
			- packaged and moved to the golgi
			- cleaved to prohormone
		- prohormone
			- almost always inactive
			- secretory vesicle
		- hormone
			- active
			- happens within the secretory vesicle
			- delivered via +calcium Ca or cyclic AMP (adenosin monophosphate) signal
			- prepackaged, released as needed
			- once they are in the blood, the half life is short
			- do not require carriers, because they are soluble
- steroid hormones
	- adrenal, gonads, placenta
	- not soluble in plasma, lipid plasma
	- use carriers, because they are soluble in lipid
	- synthesized on demand
	- concerted to active in target tissues
	- testosterone -> DHT ; testosterone -> estrogen, depending upon the target
- amino acid derivatives
	- insoluble in plasma
	- transported via carrier
	- long half life
	- conversion in target tissues

## transport carriers
- extend live of the hormone
- sequester the hormone from its target cell receptor

## receptor types
- soluble in plasma:: hydrophilic, receptor in the cell surface
	- integral membrane proteins
		- tyrosine kinase (puts phosphate) <- growth hormone -> when binded, then second msgr start the chain
		- inherent tyrosine kinase <- insulin -> phosphorilation
		- g protein coupled <- glucagon
		- steroid & thyroid hormone, can cross plasma membrane -> nuclear receptor -> changes to DNA

## target cell sensitivity
- affinity
- receptor number
- competition
- saturation

## types of stimuli
- Stimuli -> neuron (sense sodium concentration) -> secrete hormone -> anti diuretic hormone -> kidney -> dilutes sodium concentration :: neural control
- hormonal control
- low blood calcium -> paratyroid -> paratyroid hormone -> bone -> release calcium :: substrate control

## inactivation of hormone signaling
- receptor desensitization ex: type II diabetes
	- sequestration
		- remove the receptor from the surface
	- degradation
		- destroy receptor
- negative feedback
	- removes initial stimulus

## general concepts
- peptide hormones are soluble in plasma, bind cell surface receptor, are fast-acting and are short-lived
- thyroid hormones and steroid hormones are insoluble in plasma, act via intracellular receptor to change transcription, are slow acting and long lived
- binding proteins (carriers) regulate hormone availability, physiologic function, and half lives
- hormone release is under neural, hormonal, nutrient and ion regulation
- signaling is regulated by changing plasma hormone concentration and by changing target cell receptor sensitivity

# Endocrine system assessment & pathology

## assessment of function
- too much -> hyper secretion, hormone excess
- too little -> hypo-secretion, hormone insufficiency
- target cell resistance -> unresponsive
- just right -> normal or eu-secretion, works fine

## competitive binding assay
- high sensitivity and high specificity
- specific antibody -> marks the hormone -> labeled hormone
	- unlabeled hormone competes, then via subtraction we find how much unlabeled hormone there was, because we know the initial labeled hormone concentration

## bioassay = function?
- low plasma glucose -> hypothalamus -> CRH (cortico trophin) -> anterior pituitary -> ACTH (adreno cortico throphin) -> adrenal cortex -> cortisol -> negative feedback anterior pituitary + hypothalamus
- if high cortisol -> high plasma glucose -> give dexamethasone to inhibit ACTH -> ACTH lvl should fall -> - cortisol; if not -> problem with the adrenal gland
- low plasma + low cortisol -> give ACTH -> cortisol should rise -> problem was with hypothalamus or anterior pituitary

## general concepts
- pathology happens when theres too much or too little hormone or resistance to the hormone due to receptor dysfunction
- interpretation of hormone levels requires consideration of either the trophic hormone or of the ios/nutrient controlled by the hormone
