Obesogenic environments typically comprises highly-palatable and calorie-dense foods. Modeled with the cafeteria-diet protocols, this leads to robust increases in body-weight and obesity, paired with multiple maladptive eating behaviors. While the idea that hedonic intake intake is driven by higher incentive salience of palatable food has ample support in the literature, the mechanisms underlying the relationship between cateria-diet protocols and increased incentive salience are unclear. Interestingly, intermittent or uncertain access to food is capable of increasing intake and generate desensitization to specific devaluation. The goal of this review is to discuss evidence regarding the consequences of intermittent access to palatable foods on feeding behavior as this could constitue one of the underlying reasons of increased incentive salience in cafeteria-like protocols. This disruption of decision-making processess might be rooted in ancient mechanisms selected to avoid starvation, which are discussed in terms of algorithms to prevent starvation and underlying participating structures, with an emphasis on the orexin/dynorphin system in the lateral hypothalamus.
