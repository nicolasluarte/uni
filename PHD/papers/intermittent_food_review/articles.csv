Thus, it provides a good animal model to study physiological and behavioural adaptations to changes in food availability. The aim of this study was to investigate the time course of metabolic and behavioural responses to prolonged food restriction. Spiny mice were kept at an ambient temperature of 27 degrees C and for 3 weeks their food was reduced individually to 30% of their previous ad libitum food intake. When fed ad libitum, their average metabolic rate was 82.77+/-3.72 ml O(2) h(-1) during the photophase and 111.19+/-4.30 ml O(2) h(-1) during the scotophase. During food restriction they displayed episodes of daily torpor when the minimal metabolic rate gradually decreased to 16.07+/-1.07 ml O(2) h(-1), i.e. a metabolic rate depression of approximately 83%. During the hypometabolic bouts the minimum average body temperature T(b), decreased gradually from 32.6+/-0.1 degrees C to 29.0+/-0.4 degrees C, with increasing duration of consecutive bouts. In parallel, the animals increased their activity during the remaining daytime. Torpor as well as hyperactivity was suppressed immediately by refeeding. Thus golden spiny mice used two simultaneous strategies to adapt to shortened food supply, namely energysaving torpor during their resting period and an increase in locomotor activity pattern during their activity period.","Adaptive mechanisms during food restriction in Acomys russatus: the use of torpor for desert survival.","Journal of comparative physiology.

Moreover, intake of sugar sweetened beverages is often associated with high-fat food consumption in humans. We studied two different accesses to a sucrose-sweetened water (SSW, 12.3%, a concentration similar to that usually found in sugar sweetened beverages) in C57BL/6 mice fed a normal-fat (NF) or a high-fat (HF) diet in a scheduled access (7.5h). NF-fed and HF-fed mice received during 5weeks access to water, to SSW continuously for 7.5h (SSW), or to water plus SSW for 2h (randomly-chosen time slot for only 5 random days/week) (SSW-2h). Mouse preference for SSW was greater in HF-fed mice than NF-fed mice. Continuous SSW access induced weight gain whatever the diet and led to greater caloric intake than mice drinking water in NF-fed mice and in the first three weeks in HF-fed mice. In HF-fed mice, 2h-intermittent access to SSW induced a greater body weight gain than mice drinking water, and led to hyperphagia on the HF diet when SSW was accessible compared to days without SSW 2h-access (leading to greater overall caloric intake), possibly through inactivation of the anorexigenic neuropeptide POMC in the hypothalamus. This was not observed in NF-fed mice, but 2h-intermittent access to SSW stimulated the expression of dopamine, opioid and endocannabinoid receptors in the nucleus accumbens compared to water-access. In conclusion, in mice, a sucrose solution provided 2h-intermittently and a high-fat diet have combined effects on peripheral and central homeostatic systems involved in food intake regulation, a finding which has significant implications for human obesity.","Intermittent access to liquid sucrose differentially modulates energy intake and related central pathways in control or high-fat fed mice.","Physiology & behavior","Soto M and Chaumontet C and Even PC and Nadkarni N and Piedcoq J and Darcel N and Tome D and Fromentin G","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",1,2021-03-17 00:23:22,1,2021-02-22 19:39:07,-1,2021-02-25 13:50:04,,,,,,,,

Among other things, obesogenic environments are characterized by a high prevalence of external cues that are associated with highly palatable, energy-dense foods. One prominent hypothesis suggests that these external cues become such powerful conditioned elicitors of appetitive and eating behavior that they overwhelm the internal, physiological mechanisms that serve to maintain energy balance. The present research investigated a learning mechanism that may underlie this loss of internal relative to external control. In Experiment 1, rats were provided with both auditory cues (external stimuli) and varying levels of food deprivation (internal stimuli) that they could use to solve a simple discrimination task. Despite having access to clearly discriminable external cues, we found that the deprivation cues gained substantial discriminative control over conditioned responding. Experiment 2 found that, compared to standard chow, maintenance on a 'western-style' diet high in saturated fat and sugar weakened discriminative control by food deprivation cues, but did not impair learning when external cues were also trained as relevant discriminative signals for sucrose. Thus, eating a western-style diet contributed to a loss of internal control over appetitive behavior relative to external cues. We discuss how this relative loss of control by food deprivation signals may result from interference with hippocampal-dependent learning and memory processes, forming the basis of a vicious-cycle of excessive intake, body weight gain, and progressive cognitive decline that may begin very early in life.","Western-style diet impairs stimulus control by food deprivation state cues: Implications for obesogenic environments.","Appetite","Sample CH and Martin AA and Jones S and Hargrave SL and Davidson TL","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 23:17:52,-1,2021-02-25 13:51:02,,,,,,,,

In contrast, Y4-/- mice moved more but ate and drank less during the photophase, while they ate more and explored less during the scotophase. Both Y2-/- and Y4-/- mice weighed more than WT mice.

27630461,32150421,32150421,"","Binge eating behavior (BEB) is the most common condition among eating disorders. In animal models, binge eating behavior is defined as overconsumption in a brief time interval and it develops as a progressive increase in food intake along time. It is triggered by restricting food access to regular chow or to palatable food and is associated with dopamine release from the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens. The dopamine system, exhibits day-night patterns, suggesting regulation by the circadian system. This study explored in rats the differential contribution of restricted food access to chow and sucrose for developing BEB, it explored whether BEB exhibits a day-night pattern, and whether behavioral changes are associated with the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive cells in the ventral tegmental area, with the expression of dopamine 1 receptors (D1) and glutamate receptor subunit 1 receptors (GLUR1) in the nucleus accumbens. Present data indicate that under conditions of restricted access binge eating is developed for chow or sucrose. Both types of binge eating were independent of each other and exhibited a day-night pattern with increased intensity during the active phase (night). Binge eating was preceded by anticipatory activation, except when restricted food access was given during the day. Increased optical density for D1 receptors was found after exposure to the combination of restricted food access and sucrose. No association was observed between binge eating and the number of positive cells to TH in the ventral tegmental area, nor for GLUR1 in the nucleus accumbens. Present results point out the importance of time schedules to eat, highlighting an increased vulnerability to develop binge eating during the active phase.

In combination with circumstances of stress or aging, high consumption of unsaturated fatty acids and oxygen can make neural tissues sensitive to oxidative stress (OS). For adult rats, diminished level of gonadal steroid hormones accelerates OS and may result in special behavioral manifestations. This study was aimed to partially answer the question whether OS mediates trade-off between food hoarding and food intake (fat hoarding) in environmental uncertainty (e.g., fluctuations in food resource) within gonadectomized mouse model in the presence of food deprivation-induced food hoarding behavior. RESULTS: Hoarding behavior was not uniformly expressed in all male mice that exposed to food deprivation. Extended phenotypes including hoarder and non-hoarder mice stored higher and lower amounts of food respectively as compared to that of low-hoarder mice (normal phenotype) after food deprivation. Results showed that neural oxidative status was not changed in the presence of hoarding behavior in gonadectomized mice regardless of tissue type, however, glutathione levels of brain tissues were increased in the presence of hoarding behavior. Decreased superoxide dismutase activity in brain and spinal cord tissues and increased malondialdehyde in brain tissues of gonadectomized mice were also seen. CONCLUSIONS: Although, food deprivation-induced hoarding behavior is a strategic response to food shortage in mice, it did not induce the same amount of hoarding across all colony mates. Hoarding behavior, in this case, is a response to the environmental uncertainty of food shortage, therefore is not an abnormal behavior. Hoarding behavior induced neural OS with regard to an increase in brain glutathione levels but failed to show other markers of neural OS. Decreased superoxide dismutase activity in brain and spinal cord tissues and increased malondialdehyde levels in brain tissues of gonadectomized mice could be a hallmark of debilitated antioxidative defense and more lipid peroxidation due to reduced amount of gonadal steroid hormones during aging.","An effort toward molecular biology of food deprivation induced food hoarding in gonadectomized NMRI mouse model: focus on neural oxidative status.","BMC neuroscience","Nikray N and Karimi I and Siavashhaghighi Z and Becker LA and Mofatteh MM","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",1,2021-03-17 00:24:38,1,2021-02-24 19:27:56,-1,2021-02-27 14:36:08,,,,,,,,

Rats lived in cages that were attached to running wheels. Within each cage, water was freely available and lever pressing was required for access to food; a fixed number of presses was required for the delivery of a single food pellet. All cages were located in an environmental chamber where a 12-h light/dark cycle was continuously maintained. During stage I, the entrance to each running wheel was blocked and two series (series 1 and 2) of progressively increasing fixed ratios (FRs) of presses per pellet were imposed. Each FR was used for a single day. During stage II, the entrance to each wheel was unblocked and wheel running and food intake were allowed to stabilize. During stage III, the running wheels remained available and the FR was again increased (series 3). In stage I, increases in the FR reduced food intake proportionally more rapidly during the light than during the dark, and this reduction in the light was greater during series 1 than series 2. During stage II, food intake was transiently reduced during the first week of access to running wheels, but recovered by the end of the second week. During stage III, increases in the FR again reduced food intake proportionally more rapidly during the light than during the dark.

From group data, body weight is not fully defended. However, marked individual differences in degree of body weight defence were noted. During food deprivation the daily drinking cycle persists for approximately 48 hr, then a reduction in nocturnal drinking appears. General activity increases but only in the light period. After food restitution, the main hyperphagia is confined to the first post-deprivation day. Additional, subtle long term effects of overeating in the light period are also found. In contrast to food deprived groups, water deprived groups accurately defend body weight. During water deprivation daily food intakes decrease immediately whereas nocturnal activity decreases after approximately 72 hr of deprivation has elapsed.

To test the anorectic mode of action of benzodiazepine inverse agonists, the effects of FG 7142 on feeding microstructure were studied in nondeprived female Wistar rats (n=32). Microstructure analysis used a novel meal definition that recognizes prandial drinking. On pharmacologically synchronized diestrus I, rats were pretreated (-30 min dark onset) with the benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist FG 7142 (i.p. 0, 3.75, 7.5, 15 mg/kg) in a between-subjects design. FG 7142 delayed the onset of (16-541%), decreased the amount eaten (36-52%) and drunk (63-87%), and reduced the time spent drinking (59-87%) within the first nocturnal meal. Dose-dependent incremental anorexia continued 6 h into the dark cycle, whereas FG 7142 did not suppress the quantity, duration or rate of drinking past the first meal. Treated rats ate smaller meals (17-42%) of normal duration. This reflected that FG 7142 slowed feeding within meals (9-38%) by decreasing the regularity and maintenance of feeding from pellet-to-pellet. FG 7142 did not influence postprandial satiety; meal frequency and inter-meal intervals were unaffected. FG 7142 anorexia was blocked by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil in a 2:1 molar ratio (n=17 rats). The very early, nonspecific (+10 min), but not subsequent (2.5, 4.5 h) feeding-specific phase, of FG 7142 anorexia was mirrored by anxiogenic-like behavior in FG 7142-treated (7.5 mg/kg) female rats (n=48) in the elevated plus-maze.

This band was composed by the common salivary protein-1 and a prolactin-induced protein as identified by peptide mass fingerprinting. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in body weight and food intake between IMO and LL might be attributed to the sort and intensity of stressors stimuli. The changes in the volume of secreted saliva could be a compensatory mechanism in response to stressors. The increase of total protein in IMO rats and the absence of 25 kDa proteins in LL, would suggest that the submandibular glands respond to the sympathetic nervous system stimuli induced by the stress with an increase of activity of the sympathetic nerves in IMO and a reduction in LL rats.","Functional and proteomic analysis of submandibular saliva in rats exposed to chronic stress by immobilization or constant light.","Archives of oral biology","Alterman A and Mathison R and Coronel CE and Stroppa MM and Finkelberg AB and Gallara RV","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc),no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-24 18:56:34,-1,2021-02-27 14:37:12,,,,,,,,

These beliefs are not empirically based. The magnitude of trait variance associated with the estrous cycle may be sufficiently low and of little impact, or trait variability of males tested on 4 consecutive days may be as great as that of females over the 4 days of the estrous cycle. Here, we analyzed food intake data from mice in 4-day blocks, corresponding to the females' 4-day estrous cycle in several schedules of food procurement or reward. Variance was compared within and across individual mice. In no instance did the overall variance differ by sex under any of the food reward schedules.

Typically, changes in hedonic status are interpreted from a decrease in either intake or preference for a mild sucrose solution. Although the incidence of clinical depression is significantly higher in women than in men, the study of this disorder in most animal models of depression has been based on the responses of male rodents. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of 6 weeks of CMS administration among male and female rats of two rat strains, Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Long Evans (LE), with respect to physiological (body, adrenal gland, and spleen weight) and biochemical (plasma corticosterone levels) indices of stress as well as evaluations of 1 and 24 h sucrose intake and preference. Estrous cycle was tracked throughout the study. Overall, our results indicate a slower rate of weight gain in animals, greater in males, exposed to the chronic stressor regime. Furthermore, CMS is shown to disrupt estrous cycling, predominantly in the Long Evans strain of rats. The main behavioral finding was a significant reduction in 24 h sucrose intake in female treated groups, which was not accompanied by alterations in preference. Corticosterone levels were elevated in CMS-treated animals relative to the singly housed control groups, but exposure to a subsequent stressor was not influenced by the stress history. Taken together, the effects of chronic stressor exposure are evident, based on physiological and biochemical indices, although none of the measures distinguished any striking gender specific reactions. The usefulness of sucrose intake or preference as behavioral indices of CMS-induced anhedonia in males and females is modest at best.","Evaluation of the effects of chronic mild stressors on hedonic and physiological responses: sex and strain compared.","Brain research","Konkle AT and Baker SL and Kentner AC and Barbagallo LS and Merali Z and Bielajew C","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 23:22:26,-1,2021-02-25 14:03:31,,,,,,,,

An example of this is a dissociation between food-seeking behaviour and metabolic needs, a notoriously difficult-to-treat symptom of eating disorders. Feeding relies on distinct cell groups in the hypothalamus, the activity of which also changes in anticipation of feeding onset. The hypothalamus receives strong descending inputs from the lateral septum, which is connected, in turn, with cortical networks, but cognitive regulation of feeding-related behaviours is not yet understood. Cortical cognitive processing involves gamma oscillations, which support memory, attention, cognitive flexibility and sensory responses. These functions contribute crucially to feeding behaviour by unknown neural mechanisms. Here we show that coordinated gamma (30-90 Hz) oscillations in the lateral hypothalamus and upstream brain regions organize food-seeking behaviour in mice. Gamma-rhythmic input to the lateral hypothalamus from somatostatin-positive lateral septum cells evokes food approach without affecting food intake. Inhibitory inputs from the lateral septum enable separate signalling by lateral hypothalamus neurons according to their feeding-related activity, making them fire at distinct phases of the gamma oscillation. Upstream, medial prefrontal cortical projections provide gamma-rhythmic inputs to the lateral septum; these inputs are causally associated with improved performance in a food-rewarded learning task. Overall, our work identifies a top-down pathway that uses gamma synchronization to guide the activity of subcortical networks and to regulate feeding behaviour by dynamic reorganization of functional cell groups in the hypothalamus.","Gamma oscillations organize top-down signalling to hypothalamus and enable food seeking.","Nature","Carus-Cadavieco M and Gorbati M and Ye L and Bender F and van der Veldt S and Kosse C and Borgers C and Lee SY and Ramakrishnan C and Hu Y and Denisova N and Ramm F and Volitaki E and Burdakov D and Deisseroth K and Ponomarenko A and Korotkova T","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,2021-03-17 00:34:24,0,2021-02-26 14:48:43,-1,2021-02-27 14:38:02,,,,,,,,

Finally, the ad-lib rats were switched to food deprivation and the food-deprived rats were switched to free food, as rats continued responding on the response-initiated VI 30-s schedule.

METHOD: To detect heightened sensitivity to fluoxetine, young female rats were used to determine a subthreshold anorectic dose (2 mg/kg, intraperitonally). Another group of rats was either fed ad libitum or given multiple CR (to 90% body weight) and refeeding-to-satiety cycles. One half of the rats were then either spared or subjected to foot shock stress before fluoxetine treatment. RESULTS: A history of CR alone produced bingelike eating on palatable food (p < .001) and, although stress did not affect intake, it rendered CR rats hypersensitive to the satiety effect of fluoxetine. The feeding-suppression was mainly for chow (p < .05) and the effect was abolished if the rats were in negative energy balance. DISCUSSION: Results support the utility of this animal model to elucidate serotonergic changes linking dieting to binge eating. The diverse effects of fluoxetine on the type of food, and in hungry versus sated rats, suggest alternate brain mechanisms should be concomitantly targeted for improved treatment of binge eating disorders.","Stress and hunger alter the anorectic efficacy of fluoxetine in binge-eating rats with a history of caloric restriction.","The International journal of eating disorders","Placidi RJ and Chandler PC and Oswald KD and Maldonado C and Wauford PK and Boggiano MM","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-20 20:26:55,-1,2021-02-25 14:05:14,,,,,,,,

Many studies have shown that place fields are influenced by distal cues in foraging animals. However, it is largely unknown whether distal-cue-dependent changes in place fields appear in different ways in a memory task if distal cues bear direct significance to achieving goals. We investigated this possibility in this study. Rats were trained to choose different spatial positions in a radial arm in association with distal cue configurations formed by visual cue sets attached to movable curtains around the apparatus. The animals were initially trained to associate readily discernible distal cue configurations (0 degrees vs. 80 degrees angular separation between distal cue sets) with different food-well positions and then later experienced ambiguous cue configurations (14 degrees and 66 degrees ) intermixed with the original cue configurations. Rats showed no difficulty in transferring the associated memory formed for the original cue configurations when similar cue configurations were presented. Place field positions remained at the same locations across different cue configurations, whereas stability and coherence of spatial firing patterns were significantly disrupted when ambiguous cue configurations were introduced. Furthermore, the spatial representation was extended backward and skewed more negatively at the population level when processing ambiguous cue configurations, compared with when processing the original cue configurations only. This effect was more salient for large cue-separation conditions than for small cue-separation conditions. No significant rate remapping was observed across distal cue configurations. These findings suggest that place cells in the hippocampus dynamically change their detailed firing characteristics in response to a modified cue environment and that some of the firing properties previously reported in a foraging task might carry more functional weight than others when tested in a distal-cue-dependent memory task.

In Experiment 1, rats anticipated access to estrous females in the mid-light period, but also exhibited post-coital eating and running. In Experiment 2, post-coital eating and running were prevented and only a minority of rats exhibited anticipation. Rats allowed to see and smell estrous females showed no anticipation. In both experiments, all rats exhibited sustained behavioral arousal and multiple mounts and intromissions during every session, but ejaculated only every 2-3 days.

Although SREBP-1c RNA is expressed in skeletal muscle, little is known about its regulation in this tissue. To determine whether SREBP-1c is regulated by nutritional status in muscle, rats were food deprived for 48 h and then given access to a semipurified high cornstarch diet for 0, 6, 12 or 24 h. At each time point, blood was drawn for measurement of glucose and insulin concentrations, and the soleus, gastrocnemius and the white portion of the quadriceps muscle were removed for measurement of SREBP-1c RNA and protein. SREBP-1c RNA was increased (P < 0.05) by 6 h of refeeding and peaked at 12 h (fivefold in soleus and gastrocnemius, fourfold in white vastus) in all muscles studied. SREBP-1a RNA was not altered by refeeding. In accordance with the RNA data, the 125-kDa SREBP-1 protein increased with refeeding. To determine whether food deprivation decreased SREBP-1c RNA, rats were fed a high cornstarch diet during their normal diurnal cycle. Food was withdrawn at the beginning of the light cycle and muscles collected at 0, 6, 12 and 24 h after food was removed. SREBP-1c RNA decreased at all time points and was approximately 60% lower in the soleus and gastrocnemius and approximately 75% lower in the white quadriceps after 24 h. Additional refeeding experiments were conducted using a high fat diet in place of a high cornstarch diet. This diet diminished the increase in SREBP-1c RNA at all time points and in all muscles. This effect could not be explained by plasma glucose or insulin concentration.

Here, we use a risky 'closed economy' system, in which the need to acquire food and water and the need to avoid threats are simultaneously integrated into the lives of rats, to examine sex differences in mitigating threat risk while foraging. Rats lived for an extended period ( approximately 2 months) in enlarged chambers that consisted of a safe, bedded nest and a risky foraging area where footshocks could be delivered unpredictably. We observed that male and female rats used different strategies for responding to the threat of footshock. Whereas male rats increased the size of meals consumed to reduce the overall time spent foraging, female rats sacrificed their metabolic needs in order to avoid shocks. Ovarian hormone fluctuations were shown to exert slight but reliable rhythmic effects on risky decision-making in gonadally intact female rats. However, this did not produce significant differences in approach-avoidance trade-offs between ovariectomized and intact female groups, suggesting that male-female sex differences are not due to the activational effects of gonadal hormones but, rather, are likely to be organized during early development.","Sexually Dimorphic Risk Mitigation Strategies in Rats.","eNeuro","Pellman BA and Schuessler BP and Tellakat M and Kim JJ","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,2021-03-17 00:38:22,0,2021-02-22 19:07:36,-1,2021-02-25 14:07:50,,,,,,,,

The restricted group fed in the evening showed no statistical significances at diurnal periods; however, a significant decrease was observed in the dark recordings for awake time, but the SWS and PS were increased in relation to controls.

During the first dark recording, the decrease in awake time and increase in SWS were still present; however, as ad libitum food continued, these sleep parameters returned to control values, reestablishing the normal sleep pattern.

Since both groups are traditionally housed in the same room, it is possible that the environmental cues associated with placing shortening in the cages (e.g., investigator in room, cages opening and closing, etc.) provide predictable cues to the daily group, but unpredictable cues to the intermittent group. The present study examined the effects of providing predictable environmental cues to an isolated intermittent group in order to examine the independent contributions of intermittency and predictability on intake and operant performance. Two groups of rats were housed in the same room, with one group provided 30-min intermittent (INT) access and the second group provided 30-min daily access (D) to shortening. A third group (ISO) of rats was housed in a room by themselves in which all environmental cues associated with intermittent shortening availability were highly predictable. After five weeks of home cage shortening access, all rats were then exposed to several different operant schedules of reinforcement. The INT and ISO groups consumed significantly more shortening in the home cage than the D group. In contrast, the INT group earned significantly more reinforcers than both the ISO and D groups under all but one of the reinforcement schedules, while ISO and D did not differ. These data indicate that intermittent access will generate binge-type eating in the home cage independent of cue predictability.

Next, the unshifted rats were subjected to a 6-h advance in their LD cycle. One month later, all rats were again probed with food deprivation. Delayed timed-fed rats continued to run more at 1200-1500 h than their free-fed controls, but timed-fed and free-fed phase-advanced rats showed similar activity patterns after the phase advance. However, when activity patterns before these probes were subtracted, timed-fed advanced rats showed greater 'responses' to food deprivation at 0001-0300 h than their free-fed controls, i.e., 6 h earlier than before the phase advance.

Intraventricular (ivt) injections of NPY during the final hours of the light period induced feeding in a dose-related manner. While the lowest dose tested (0.02 nM) was without effect, higher doses (0.12, 0.47, 2.3 nM) uniformly elicited feeding with a latency of about 15 min in male rats. With the most effective dose, 0.47 nM, the increased food intake was due to an increased local eating rate. In contrast, the pattern of feeding behavior after a related peptide, rat pancreatic polypeptide (rPP), was quite different and less impressive. During the first hour, only one ivt dose of rPP (0.45 nM) evoked an increase in food intake, due to an increased time spent eating. Further, the effects of NPY on food intake were greater during the nocturnal period. Interestingly, increased food intake in nocturnal tests (4 h) was due solely to augmented intake during the first 60 min after ivt administration. In mating tests, initiated 2 h after the onset of darkness and 10 min after ivt administration of peptide, all but the lowest dose of NPY (0.01 nM) drastically suppressed ejaculatory behavior. Most rats treated with higher doses of NPY (0.02, 0.12, or 0.47 nM) mounted and intromitted only a few times before the cessation of sexual activity, and elongated latencies to the initial mount and intromission were observed. In contrast to the dramatic NPY-induced suppression of ejaculatory behavior, rPP (0.11 and 0.45 nM) was without effect on copulatory behavior. To substantiate further that the impairment of sexual behavior seen in NPY-treated rats was not due to an attenuated sexual ability, an additional experiment was performed. Penile reflexes, including erection, were monitored 10 min after ivt injection of NPY (0.12 nM), rPP (0.11 nM), or saline. No effect of NPY or rPP was observed on the proportion of rats showing erection or latency to initial erection, or in the number of erections per test. In fact, a slight facilitation of penile dorsiflexion responses was seen after NPY. These findings suggest that NPY selectively depresses sexual motivation in the male rat. In ovariectomized female rats responding to estrogen plus progesterone with a good level of sexual receptivity (lordosis quotient greater than 70), ivt saline and 0.01 nM NPY were without effect on sexual behavior.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","Neuropeptide Y stimulates feeding but inhibits sexual behavior in rats.","Endocrinology","Clark JT and Kalra PS and Kalra SP","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 14:03:56,-1,2021-02-25 14:17:02,,,,,,,,

Dysregulation of dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAS) has been implicated in reward-seeking behaviors, such as binge eating, which contributes to treatment resistance in obesity (Wise, 2012). Direct modulation of the NAS with deep brain stimulation (DBS), a surgical procedure currently under investigation in humans for the treatment of major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and addiction, may also be effective in ameliorating binge eating. Therefore, we examined the ability of DBS of the NAS to block this behavior in mice. c-Fos immunoreactivity was assessed as a marker of DBS-mediated neuronal activation. NAS DBS was found to reduce binge eating and increased c-Fos levels in this region. DBS of the dorsal striatum had no influence on this behavior, demonstrating anatomical specificity for this effect. The dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, raclopride, attenuated the action of DBS, whereas the D1 receptor antagonist, SCH-23390, was ineffective, suggesting that dopamine signaling involving D2 receptors underlies the effect of NAS DBS. To determine the potential translational relevance to the obese state, chronic NAS DBS was also examined in diet-induced obese mice and was found to acutely reduce caloric intake and induce weight loss. Together, these findings support the involvement of the mesolimbic dopamine pathways in the hedonic mechanisms contributing to obesity, and the efficacy of NAS DBS to modulate this system.","Amelioration of binge eating by nucleus accumbens shell deep brain stimulation in mice involves D2 receptor modulation.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Halpern CH and Tekriwal A and Santollo J and Keating JG and Wolf JA and Daniels D and Bale TL","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 22:56:23,-1,2021-02-25 14:17:46,,,,,,,,

To study the effects of this neuropeptide on ingestive behavior, we examined the effects of centrally infused hUcn II (i.c.v. 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0 micro g) on the microstructure of nose-poke responding for food and water in nondeprived, male rats. Malaise-inducing properties of the peptide were monitored using conditioned taste aversion (CTA) testing. To identify potential sites of action, central induction of Fos protein expression was examined. hUcn II dose dependently reduced the quantity and duration of responding for food and water at doses lower (0.01-1.0 micro g) than that forming a CTA (10 micro g). Effects were most evident during hours 4 to 6 of the dark cycle. Meal pattern analysis showed that hUcn II potently (0.1 micro g) increased the satiating value of food. Rats ate and drank smaller and shorter meals without changing meal frequency. Rats also ate more slowly. hUcn II induced Fos in regions involved in visceral sensory processing and autonomic/neuroendocrine regulation and resembling those activated by appetite suppressants. hUcn II is a promising neuropeptide for investigating the role of the CRF(2) receptor in ingestive behavior.","Human urocortin II, a selective agonist for the type 2 corticotropin-releasing factor receptor, decreases feeding and drinking in the rat.","The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics","Inoue K and Valdez GR and Reyes TM and Reinhardt LE and Tabarin A and Rivier J and Vale WW and Sawchenko PE and Koob GF and Zorrilla EP","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 20:45:31,-1,2021-02-25 14:19:50,,,,,,,,

Impulsivity, a predisposition toward rapid unplanned reactions to stimuli, is one of the multifaceted determinants underlying the etiology of dysregulated eating and its evolving pathogenesis. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a major neural director of reward-driven behavior and impulsivity. Compromised signaling between the mPFC and nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) is thought to underlie the cognitive inability to withhold prepotent responses (motor impulsivity) and binge intake of high-fat food (HFF) seen in binge eating disorder. To explore the relationship between motor impulsivity and binge-like eating in rodents, we identified high (HI) and low impulsive (LI) rats in the 1-choice serial reaction time task and employed a rat model of binge-like eating behavior. HFF binge rats consumed significantly greater calories relative to control rats maintained on continual access to standard food or HFF. HI rats repeatedly exhibited significantly higher bingeing on HFF vs. LI rats. Next, we employed dual viral vector chemogenetic technology which allows for the targeted and isolated modulation of ventral mPFC (vmPFC) neurons that project to the NAcSh. Chemogenetic activation of the vmPFC to NAcSh pathway significantly suppressed motor impulsivity and binge-like intake for high-fat food. Thus, inherent motor impulsivity and binge-like eating are linked and the vmPFC to NAcSh pathway serves as a 'brake' over both behaviors.","Convergent neural connectivity in motor impulsivity and high-fat food binge-like eating in male Sprague-Dawley rats.","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Anastasio NC and Stutz SJ and Price AE and Davis-Reyes BD and Sholler DJ and Ferguson SM and Neumaier JF and Moeller FG and Hommel JD and Cunningham KA","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-20 20:19:24,-1,2021-02-25 14:20:23,,,,,,,,

In rodents, anandamide stimulates eating by actions at central CB1 receptors, and hypothalamic endocannabinoids may be under the negative control of leptin. However, changes to brain endocannabinoid levels in direct relation to feeding or changing nutritional status have not been investigated. We measured anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) levels in feeding-associated brain regions of rats, during fasting, feeding of a palatable food, or after satiation. Endocannabinoid levels were compared to those in rats fed ad libitum, at a point in their daily cycle when motivation to eat was absent. Fasting increased levels of anandamide and 2-AG in the limbic forebrain and, to a lesser extent, of 2-AG in the hypothalamus. By contrast, hypothalamic 2-AG declined as animals ate. No changes were detected in satiated rats. Endocannabinoid levels in the cerebellum, a control region not directly involved in the control of food intake, were unaffected by any manipulation. As 2-AG was most sensitive to variation during feeding, and to leptin regulation in a previous study, we examined the behavioural effects of 2-AG when injected into the nucleus accumbens shell, a limbic forebrain area strongly linked to eating motivation. 2-AG potently, and dose-dependently, stimulated feeding. This effect was attenuated by the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716. These findings provide the first direct evidence of altered brain levels of endocannabinoids, and of 2-AG in particular, during fasting and feeding. The nature of these effects supports a role for endocannabinoids in the control of appetitive motivation.","Endocannabinoid levels in rat limbic forebrain and hypothalamus in relation to fasting, feeding and satiation: stimulation of eating by 2-arachidonoyl glycerol.","British journal of pharmacology","Kirkham TC and Williams CM and Fezza F and Di Marzo V","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-27 19:53:56,-1,2021-03-11 03:44:53,,,,,,,,

Chronically elevated glucocorticoids, which have considerable impacts on physiological processes such as intermediary metabolism, inflammation, and fat metabolism, have also been implicated in insulin resistance associated with obesity and diabetes. In this study, the effects of high-fat diet (HFD) or chronic circadian challenge in C57BL/6J mice on basal and stress-induced corticosterone (CORT) and blood glucose levels were assessed. Baseline and stress-induced levels of CORT, insulin and glucose were measured before and after acute restraint stress at 4 different time points across the light-dark cycle (LD) in male C57BL/6J mice maintained for 8weeks on HFD or regular chow. After 8weeks on diet, baseline CORT levels in HFD mice were of similar magnitude but more variable than in mice on low-fat diet, rendering their daily fluctuations arrhythmic according to statistical analysis. Baseline glucose measures were unchanged despite significant 3-fold increases in baseline insulin levels in HFD mice at all time points sampled. Restraint stress yielded considerable decreases in insulin levels and increases in CORT and glucose levels that were significantly exaggerated in the early active period in mice on HFD. These results indicate a circadian influence on stress responses after prolonged consumption of high fat diet. In a separate experiment, C57BL/6J mice were subjected to 6weeks of an alternating light-dark (LD) cycle comprised of 6h advances and delays of phase every 5days to keep the circadian system from establishing consistent circadian entrainment, with a control group of mice under a regular 12:12 LD cycle. While body weights were not significantly affected by chronic circadian challenge, the basal CORT rhythm in alternating-LD mice was significantly dampened. Stress-induced CORT in alternating LD were no different from regular LD group with the exception of ZT 18, at which time the stress response was moderately suppressed compared to controls. These results support that high-fat diet may be contributing to health disorders such as obesity and diabetes in a manner different from any effects of chronic circadian disruption.","Effects of high fat diet and chronic circadian challenge on glucocorticoid regulation in C57BL/6J mice.","Physiology & behavior","Appiakannan HS and Kestyus DR and Weber ET","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 23:18:17,-1,2021-02-25 14:21:38,,,,,,,,

In the first case, the behavior pattern is determined by a scalar timing process with an arbitrary-reset property. In contrast, under daily cycles of food-availability, behavior reflects a self-sustaining oscillation. With rats as subjects, the concurrent operation of timing of both kinds was studied by addition of premeal auditory cues on the circadian baseline, in the absence of a day-night illumination cycle. Cues within both minute and hour ranges served to lower the level of premeal anticipatory responding, although exponential accelerations were similar to the uncued case. Cues within the minutes range yielded interval-timing functions that reflected approximate superposition. Cues within the hours range suppressed respondings at their outset, in proportion to cue duration. When one of the shorter cues was suddenly lengthened, short-interval accelerations appeared at inappropriate circadian phases. When a premeal cue was extended through mealtime, anticipation rates increased markedly, suggesting that cue termination at the start of mealtime is a potent anchor for premeal anticipation regardless of cue duration. By use of meal-omission probes without external cues, peak rates were located after the onset of expected mealtime, often near its termination.

Although MSG flavor preference has been attributed to its taste, vagally-mediated post-oral detection has also been demonstrated. Recent studies showed that water-restricted rats acquired a preference for a flavor paired with intragastric (IG) infusion of 60 mM MSG in rats. The present study extends this work by comparing MSG-based flavor conditioning in water- and food-restricted rats and testing the persistence of flavor preferences. Rats with IG catheters drank flavored solutions paired with volume-matched infusions of 60 mM MSG or water in daily 30-min sessions. Two training/test cycles were conducted, each with eight one-bottle training sessions followed by two two-bottle preference tests without infusions. Food- and water-restricted groups displayed similar preferences for the MSG-paired flavor. When non-reinforced testing was continued after the second cycle, the food-restricted group sustained its preference across three 2-day tests, but water-restricted rats lost their preference. Other food-restricted rats learned to prefer a flavor paired with intraduodenal infusion, indicating that gastric stimulation by MSG is not required. A third experiment showed that adding 2 mM of the nucleotide inosine monophosphate to the IG infusion of MSG did not significantly enhance flavor conditioning. Because MSG-based flavor preferences can be obtained with infusions that bypass the stomach, the site for detecting MSG reinforcement may be intestinal.","Flavor preferences conditioned by post-oral infusion of monosodium glutamate in rats.","Physiology & behavior","Ackroff K and Sclafani A","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 19:37:50,-1,2021-02-25 14:22:13,,,,,,,,

Insulin modulates the central dopaminergic response and changes behavioral responses to reward. We measured the release of dopamine in the accumbens during palatable food intake in IUGR rats both at baseline and in response to insulin. From pregnancy day 10 until birth, gestating Sprague-Dawley rats received either an ad libitum (Control), or a 50% food restricted (FR) diet. In adulthood, palatable food consumption and feeding behavior entropy was assessed using an electronic food intake monitor (BioDAQ(R)), and dopamine response to palatable food was measured by chronoamperometry recordings in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). FR rats eat more palatable foods during the dark phase, and their eating pattern has a higher entropy compared to control rats. There was a delayed dopamine release in the FR group in response to palatable food and insulin administration reverted this delayed effect. Western blot showed a decrease in suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 protein (SOCS3) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and an increase in the ratio of phospho-tyrosine hydroxylase to tyrosine hydroxylase (pTH/TH) in the NAcc of FR rats. Administration of insulin also abolished this latter effect in FR rats. FR rats showed metabolic alterations and a delay in the dopaminergic response to palatable foods. This could explain the increased palatable food intake and behavioral entropy found in FR rats.

Temporal restricted feeding, a potent synchronizer of peripheral oscillators, has only weak influence on light-entrained rhythms via the SCN, unless restricted feeding is coupled with calorie restriction, thereby altering phase angle of photic synchronization. Effects of daytime restricted feeding were investigated on the mouse circadian system. Normocaloric feeding at midday led to a predominantly diurnal (60%) food intake and decreased blood glucose in the afternoon, but it did not affect the phase of locomotor activity rhythm or vasopressin expression in the SCN. In contrast, hypocaloric feeding at midday led to 2-4 h phase advances of three circadian outputs, locomotor activity rhythm, pineal melatonin, and vasopressin mRNA cycle in the SCN, and it decreased daily levels of blood glucose. Furthermore, Per1 and Cry2 oscillations in the SCN were phase advanced by 1 and 3 h, respectively, in hypocalorie- but not in normocalorie-fed mice. The phase of Per2 and Bmal1 expression remained unchanged regardless of feeding condition. Moreover, the shape of behavioral phase-response curve to light and light-induced expression of Per1 in the SCN were markedly modified in hypocalorie-fed mice compared with animals fed ad libitum. The present study shows that diurnal hypocaloric feeding affects not only the temporal organization of the SCN clockwork and circadian outputs in mice under light/dark cycle but also photic responses of the circadian system, thus indicating that energy metabolism modulates circadian rhythmicity and gating of photic inputs in mammals.","Feeding cues alter clock gene oscillations and photic responses in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of mice exposed to a light/dark cycle.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Mendoza J and Graff C and Dardente H and Pevet P and Challet E","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc),no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-24 19:17:20,-1,2021-02-27 14:43:50,,,,,,,,

Because an animal cannot eat and sleep at the same time, brain systems that regulate energy homeostasis are likely to influence sleep/wake behavior. Indeed, previous studies indicate that animals adjust sleep cycles around periods of food need and availability. Furthermore, hormones that affect energy homeostasis also affect sleep/wake states: the orexigenic hormone ghrelin promotes wakefulness, and the anorexigenic hormones leptin and insulin increase the duration of slow-wave sleep. However, whether neural populations that regulate feeding can influence sleep/wake states is unknown. The hypothalamic arcuate nucleus contains two neuronal populations that exert opposing effects on energy homeostasis: agouti-related protein (AgRP)-expressing neurons detect caloric need and orchestrate food-seeking behavior, whereas activity in pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons induces satiety. We tested the hypotheses that AgRP neurons affect sleep homeostasis by promoting states of wakefulness, whereas POMC neurons promote states of sleep. Indeed, optogenetic or chemogenetic stimulation of AgRP neurons in mice promoted wakefulness while decreasing the quantity and integrity of sleep. Inhibition of AgRP neurons rescued sleep integrity in food-deprived mice, highlighting the physiological importance of AgRP neuron activity for the suppression of sleep by hunger. Conversely, stimulation of POMC neurons promoted sleep states and decreased sleep fragmentation in food-deprived mice. Interestingly, we also found that sleep deprivation attenuated the effects of AgRP neuron activity on food intake and wakefulness.

Rodents placed on a fixed feeding schedule show behavioral and physiological anticipation of mealtime referred to as food-anticipatory activity (FAA). FAA is driven by the food-entrainable oscillator (FEO), whose anatomical substrate is not yet known. Recent data have shown that restricted feeding schedules for regular chow and daily limited access to palatable food in free-feeding rats activate distinct brain regions during FAA. The combination of a deprivation regimen and scheduled access to palatable food may give rise to a more global anticipatory mechanism because the temporal cycles of energy balance would be strongly modulated by the incentive properties of palatable food; however, the neuronal response to this combined treatment is not yet known. The present study investigated how adding palatable sucrose to feeding schedules affects the pattern of brain c-fos mRNA expression during FAA (0-3 h) and 1 h following feeding. The rats maintained on scheduled chow access increased their daily chow intake, while the rats maintained on scheduled sucrose and chow mainly increased their daily sucrose intake. Adding sucrose to scheduled feeding displaced c-fos mRNA expression from the dorsomedial and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei and posterior lateral hypothalamus (LH) to the prefrontal cortex, lateral septum, nucleus accumbens and anterior LH. During refeeding, the rats on scheduled sucrose demonstrated higher activation of the nucleus of the solitary tract. The present results suggest that palatable sucrose combined with restricted feeding schedules activate a distinct neuronal network compared to neuronal activation produced by scheduled access to regular chow. These data provide evidence that the brain may contain different food-oscillatory systems and that food palatability may shift the neuronal activity from the medial hypothalamus to the limbic and reward-related areas even at the negative metabolic state.","Sucrose modifies c-fos mRNA expression in the brain of rats maintained on feeding schedules.","Neuroscience","Mitra A and Lenglos C and Martin J and Mbende N and Gagne A and Timofeeva E","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,2021-03-17 00:42:03,0,2021-02-23 14:39:02,-1,2021-02-25 14:24:01,,,,,,,,

The proposal that this may not necessarily be so was explored by testing the behaviour of rats which had been undernourished at later stages of life and which, therefore, would be expected to show little or no deficit in brain growth. Rats were undernourished either immediately after weaning (25-67 days) or in adulthood (80-134 days) and were tested 3-4 months later on variable interval and variable ratio schedules of reinforcement with food as the reward. Their behaviour on these schedules was similar to that of rats undernourished during the suckling period: both groups responded or tended to respond at a higher rate than controls.

It was also our intention to extend the validation of the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) - the first tool developed to identify individuals with addictive tendencies towards food. Using a sample of obese adults (aged 25-45 years), and a case-control methodology, we focused our assessments on three domains relevant to the characterization of conventional substance-dependence disorders: clinical co-morbidities, psychological risk factors, and abnormal motivation for the addictive substance. Results were strongly supportive of the FA construct and validation of the YFAS. Those who met the diagnostic criteria for FA had a significantly greater co-morbidity with Binge Eating Disorder, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder compared to their age- and weight-equivalent counterparts. Those with FA were also more impulsive and displayed greater emotional reactivity than obese controls. They also displayed greater food cravings and the tendency to 'self-soothe' with food. These findings advance the quest to identify clinically relevant subtypes of obesity that may possess different vulnerabilities to environmental risk factors, and thereby could inform more personalized treatment approaches for those who struggle with overeating and weight gain.","Evidence that 'food addiction' is a valid phenotype of obesity.","Appetite","Davis C and Curtis C and Levitan RD and Carter JC and Kaplan AS and Kennedy JL","study with other mammals other than rat mice,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 19:37:15,-1,2021-02-25 14:25:28,,,,,,,,

By monitoring neuronal ensembles in mouse dCA1-->NAc pathway, combined with cell-type selective optogenetic manipulations of input-defined postsynaptic neurons, we show that dCA1 PYRs drive NAc medium spiny neurons and orchestrate their spiking activity using feedforward inhibition mediated by dCA1-connected parvalbumin-expressing fast-spiking interneurons. This tripartite cross-circuit motif supports spatial appetitive memory and associated NAc assemblies, being independent of dorsal subiculum and dispensable for both spatial novelty detection and reward seeking.

Likewise, preferential MOR occupancy versus KOR and DOR was observed by autoradiography in brain slices from Long Evans rats dosed orally with the drug. GSK1521498 suppressed nocturnal food consumption of standard or palatable chow in lean and diet-induced obese (DIO) Long Evans rats. Both the dose-response relationship and time course of efficacy in lean rats fed palatable chow correlated with mu receptor occupancy and the plasma concentration profile of the drug. Chronic oral administration of GSK1521498 induced body weight loss in DIO rats, which comprised fat mass reduction. The reduction in body weight was equivalent to the cumulative reduction in food consumption; thus, the effect of GSK1521498 on body weight is related to inhibition of food consumption. GSK1521498 suppressed the preference for sucrose-containing solutions in lean rats. In operant response models also using lean rats, GSK1521498 reduced the reinforcement efficacy of palatable food reward and enhanced satiety.

It has been hypothesized that certain food-anticipatory rhythms are linked to the induction and entrainment of rhythms in clock gene expression in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH), a putative food-entrained circadian oscillator. To study this concept further, we made food availability unpredictable by presenting the meal at a random time each day (variable restricted feeding, VRF), either during the day, night or throughout the 24-h cycle. Wheel running activity and the expression of the clock protein, Period1 (PER1), in the DMH and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) were assessed. Rats exhibited increased levels of activity during the portion of the day when food was randomly presented but, as expected, failed to entrain anticipatory wheel running activity to a single time of day. PER1 expression in the SCN was unchanged by VRF schedules. In the DMH, PER1 expression became rhythmic, peaking at opposite times of day in rats fed only during the day or during the night. In rats fed randomly throughout the entire 24-h cycle, PER1 expression in the DMH remained arrhythmic, but was elevated. These results demonstrate that VRF schedules confined to the day or night can induce circadian rhythms of clock gene expression in the DMH. Such feeding schedules cannot entrain behavioral rhythms, thereby showing that food-entrainment of behavior and circadian rhythms of clock gene expression in the DMH are dissociable.","Circadian rhythms of PERIOD1 expression in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus in the absence of entrained food-anticipatory activity rhythms in rats.","The European journal of neuroscience","Verwey M and Lam GY and Amir S","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc)",-1,,-1,2021-02-24 18:53:44,-1,2021-02-27 14:46:38,,,,,,,,

This study was aimed at determining whether antagonism of Sigma-1 receptors (Sig-1Rs) blocked compulsive-like binge eating. We trained male wistar rats to obtain a sugary, highly palatable diet (Palatable group) or a regular chow diet (Chow control group), for 1 h a day under fixed ratio 1 operant conditioning. Following intake stabilization, we evaluated the effects of the selective Sig-1R antagonist BD-1063 on food responding. Using a light/dark conflict test, we also tested whether BD-1063 could block the time spent and the food eaten in an aversive, open compartment, where the palatable diet was offered. Furthermore, we measured Sig-1R mRNA and protein expression in several brain areas of the two groups, 24 h after the last binge session. Palatable rats rapidly developed binge-like eating, escalating the 1 h intake by four times, and doubling the eating rate and the regularity of food responding, compared to Chow rats. BD-1063 dose-dependently reduced binge-like eating and the regularity of food responding, and blocked the increased eating rate in Palatable rats. In the light/dark conflict test, BD-1063 antagonized the increased time spent in the aversive compartment and the increased intake of the palatable diet, without affecting motor activity. Finally, Palatable rats showed reduced Sig-1R mRNA expression in prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, and a two-fold increase in Sig-1R protein expression in anterior cingulate cortex compared to control Chow rats. These findings suggest that the Sig-1R system may contribute to the neurobiological adaptations driving compulsive-like eating, opening new avenues of investigation towards pharmacologically treating binge eating disorder.","Antagonism of sigma-1 receptors blocks compulsive-like eating.","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Cottone P and Wang X and Park JW and Valenza M and Blasio A and Kwak J and Iyer MR and Steardo L and Rice KC and Hayashi T and Sabino V","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 14:00:29,-1,2021-02-25 14:26:25,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: A modification of the model based on the combination of cyclic caloric restrictions and acute stress was developed to further increase its face validity and reliability and, for the first time, to assess its predictive value. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four groups of female rats were employed: group 1 was normally fed and not stressed on the test day (25th); group 2 was fed normally but was exposed to an acute stress on day 25; group 3 was exposed to three cycles (4 days 66% of chow intake + 4 days food ad libitum) of yo-yo dieting but not stressed; and group 4 was exposed to cyclic yo-yo dieting and then stressed. All groups were fed highly palatable food (HPF) for 2 h on days 5-6 and 13-14. Acute stress was elicited by exposing rats to HPF, but preventing them from access to it for 15 min. RESULTS: The combination of cyclic food restriction and stressful exposure to food markedly increased HPF intake. Sibutramine and fluoxetine inhibited food intake in all conditions. Topiramate selectively inhibited compulsive HPF intake in rats submitted to caloric restriction and stress. Midazolam increased HPF intake. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological results suggest that this model, in addition to face validity as an isomorphic model of human binge eating, is endowed with good predictive validity.","A preclinical model of binge eating elicited by yo-yo dieting and stressful exposure to food: effect of sibutramine, fluoxetine, topiramate, and midazolam.","Psychopharmacology","Cifani C and Polidori C and Melotto S and Ciccocioppo R and Massi M","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,2021-03-17 00:45:39,-1,2021-02-22 19:12:35,1,2021-02-25 14:27:36,,,,,,,,

The onset of BED occurs most frequently in adolescent or young adult females and is often associated with a history of dieting and psychological stress. Animal research suggests the importance of two synergistic factors in the aetiology of binge eating: a history of restriction-refeeding cycles (i.e., 'yo-yo' dieting) and exposure to acute stress. In the rat, natural variations in maternal licking and grooming (LG) of pups during the first week of life are associated with long-lasting individual differences in offspring sensitivity to stress. The current set of experiments examined the effects of restriction--refeeding--footshock cycles on intake of highly palatable (HP) food in adolescent and adult female offspring of Low, Mid, and High LG dams. Following cycles of food restriction or unlimited food access, sated rats were exposed to footshock and their intake of HP food and chow was measured at 2, 4, and 22 h post-shock. Adolescent offspring of Low LG mothers displayed shock-induced binge eating, regardless of food-restriction history. In contrast, adolescent female offspring of Mid and High LG mothers failed to exhibit shock-induced increases in food intake. We saw no evidence of binge eating when shock was introduced in adulthood. The data suggest that low levels of maternal care in early life are associated with greater vulnerability to the later development of stress-related binge eating and further that this heightened vulnerability manifests during the adolescent period.","Variations in maternal care influence vulnerability to stress-induced binge eating in female rats.","Physiology & behavior","Hancock SD and Menard JL and Olmstead MC","drug, optogenetic or comoribities at the time of intermittent protocol",-1,2021-03-17 00:46:44,1,2021-02-16 17:46:38,-1,2021-02-17 00:22:52,,,,,,,,

For this reason, meal pattern measures are often used as a way to infer how rodents respond to tastants or how pharmacological or surgical treatments modify ingestive behavior. This approach relies on the assumption that under normal conditions, the meal patterns of individual rats are consistent across consecutive light-dark (L-D) cycles. If these patterns are inconsistent, then experimental designs involving meal patterns would have limited power, and thus require relatively large sample sizes. The present study critically evaluates the consistency assumption in Sprague-Dawley and Fisher-344 rats by monitoring meal patterns over 10 consecutive L-D cycles. For each rat, the following feeding and drinking measures were determined: total daily intake, duration of night bouts, number of night bouts, and number of licks per night bout. The analysis excluded daytime ingestive measures owing to their infrequent occurrence. Ingestive measures were highly consistent across time in all Sprague-Dawleys, but in only a minority of the Fisher-344s. The distribution of feeding and drinking activity throughout each night was also determined in the same rats. Whereas Sprague-Dawleys displayed lights-off and lights-on peaks of ingestive activity, only a minority of Fisher-344s displayed a consistent lights-on peak of ingestive activity. It is concluded that rat strains can differ with respect to the consistency of meal patterning, and that such strain differences should be considered in future comparative studies of meal patterns in rats.","Consistency of meal patterns in laboratory rats.","Physiology & behavior","Glendinning JI and Smith JC","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 21:19:24,-1,2021-02-25 14:28:09,,,,,,,,

To determine whether there was a circadian pattern of extracellular NE in freely-eating subjects, samples of dialysate from the vicinity of the PVN were collected and assayed for NE every 2 hrs for 48 hrs. The pattern of NE averaged across subjects was similar during both 24-hr periods, with a reliable peak at the beginning of the dark cycle and relatively stable levels at all other times. When these animals were subsequently deprived of food for 24 hrs, a gradual rise in extracellular NE was observed, ultimately increasing to 215% of the predeprivation level. When the animals were refed and NE measurements were continued at more frequent intervals, extracellular levels were found to decline during the first 20 min of eating, as well as over the next 3 hrs as food intake diminished. These patterns of extracellular NE, together with previous evidence, suggest that endogenous NE in the PVN plays a role in the initiation and/or maintenance of normal eating behavior at the beginning of the nocturnal feeding period, as well as after food deprivation.","Patterns of extracellular norepinephrine in the paraventricular hypothalamus: relationship to circadian rhythm and deprivation-induced eating behavior.","Life sciences","Stanley BG and Schwartz DH and Hernandez L and Hoebel BG and Leibowitz SF","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-26 14:55:24,-1,2021-02-27 14:47:13,,,,,,,,

In the present study, high affinity receptor-selective antagonists were used to determine the particular opioid receptor type(s) that mediates the facilitation of reward by food restriction. Separate groups of food-restricted and ad libitum fed rats were used to conduct i.c.v. dose-response studies with TCTAP (mu), norbinaltorphimine (kappa), and naltrindole (delta). The highest dose of naltrindole (50.0 nmol) raised self-stimulation threshold independently of feeding condition. This suggests that delta opioid activity is involved in self-stimulation under basal conditions and may explain previous findings that high systemic doses of naloxone or naltrexone reduce self-stimulation. The highest doses of TCTAP and norbinaltorphimine (5.0 and 50.0 nmol, respectively) reversed the lowering of self-stimulation threshold produced by food restriction while having no effect on thresholds of ad libitum fed rats. These results suggest that state-dependent mu and kappa opioid activity facilitate reward. Since food restriction is known to increase the rewarding effect of food and drugs of abuse, the opioid mechanism identified in the present study may mediate adaptive behavior and, under some circumstances, pathological behavior.

Here, we provide evidence that enkephalin surges in an anteromedial quadrant of dorsal neostriatum contribute to generating intense consumption of palatable food. In ventral striatum, mu opioid circuitry contributes an important component of motivation to consume reward. In dorsal neostriatum, mu opioid receptors are concentrated within striosomes that receive inputs from limbic regions of prefrontal cortex. We employed advanced opioid microdialysis techniques that allow detection of extracellular enkephalin levels. Endogenous >150% enkephalin surges in anterior dorsomedial neostriatum were triggered as rats began to consume palatable chocolates. In contrast, dynorphin levels remained unchanged. Furthermore, a causal role for mu opioid stimulation in overconsumption was demonstrated by observations that microinjection in the same anterior dorsomedial quadrant of a mu receptor agonist ([D-Ala2, N-MePhe4, Gly-ol]-enkephalin; DAMGO) generated intense >250% increases in intake of palatable sweet food (without altering hedonic impact of sweet tastes). Mapping by 'Fos plume' methods confirmed the hyperphagic effect to be anatomically localized to the anteromedial quadrant of the dorsal neostriatum, whereas other quadrants were relatively ineffective.

The acute effect of darkness and light per se being experimentally excluded, it was concluded that the size of the first meal following short term food deprivation was dependent throughout the diurnal cycle on the fast induced glucoprivic condition.","Food deprivation induced parallel changes in blood glucose, plasma free fatty acids and feeding during two parts of the diurnal cycle in rats.","Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews","Le Magnen J and Devos M and Larue-Achagiotis C","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-26 14:49:00,-1,2021-02-27 14:48:32,,,,,,,,

In Experiment 1, rats were tested under sated or food-deprived conditions to determine whether fasting would augment cue-driven feeding. Rats in the control group regulated intake based on physiological state, while conditioned rats consumed similar large amounts of food regardless. Experiment 2 tested the durability of cue-potentiated feeding to repeated testing in sated rats. We observed robust cue-potentiated feeding during the first two tests, while in the third and fourth tests both groups ate similar large amounts of pellets. In both experiments the conditioned tone-cue induced binge-like consumption of the cued food and persistent feeding for the duration of 4-h tests. Rats then failed to adjust daily chow consumption to account for their increased intake post-cue.

The present work extends this idea by examining striatal activity during dynamic shifts in value that include different levels and directions of magnitude disparity. A novel task was used to produce diverse relative reward effects on a chain of instrumental action. Rats (Rattus norvegicus) were trained to respond to cues associated with specific outcomes varying by food pellet magnitude. Animals were exposed to single-outcome sessions followed by mixed-outcome sessions, and neural activity was compared among identical outcome trials from the different behavioral contexts. Results recording striatal activity show that neural responses to different task elements reflect incentive contrast as well as other relative effects that involve generalization between outcomes or possible influences of outcome variety. The activity that was most prevalent was linked to food consumption and post-food consumption periods. Relative encoding was sensitive to magnitude disparity. A within-session analysis showed strong contrast effects that were dependent upon the outcome received in the immediately preceding trial. Significantly higher numbers of responses were found in ventral striatum linked to relative outcome effects. Our results support the idea that relative value can incorporate diverse relationships, including comparisons from specific individual outcomes to general behavioral contexts.

Feeding is a complex behavioral program supported through the function of multiple brain regions and influenced by a diverse array of receptor signaling pathways. Previous studies have shown the overexpression of the opioid neuropeptide nociceptin (orphanin FQ, N/OFQ) can induce hyperphagia, but the role of endogenous nociceptin receptor (NOP) in naturally occurring palatability-induced hyperphagia is unknown. In this study we adapted a simple, replicable form of binge eating of high fat food (HFD). We found that male and female C57BL/6J mice provided with daily one-hour access sessions to HFD eat significantly more during this period than those provided with continuous 24h access. This form of feeding is rapid and entrained. Chronic intermittent HFD binge eating produced hyperactivity and increased light zone exploration in the open field and light-dark assays respectively. Treatment with the potent and selective NOP antagonist SB 612111 resulted in a significant dose-dependent reduction in binge intake in both male and female mice, and, unlike treatment with the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine, produced no change in total 24-h food intake. SB 612111 treatment also significantly decreased non-binge-like acute HFD consumption in male mice. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that high fat binge eating is modulated by NOP signaling and that the NOP system may represent a promising novel receptor to explore for the treatment of binge eating.","Nociceptin receptor antagonist SB 612111 decreases high fat diet binge eating.","Behavioural brain research","Hardaway JA and Jensen J and Kim M and Mazzone CM and Sugam JA and Diberto JF and Lowery-Gionta EG and Hwa LS and Pleil KE and Bulik CM and Kash TL","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",1,2021-03-17 00:57:09,-1,2021-02-20 20:09:41,1,2021-02-25 14:31:43,,,,,,,,

Feeding regimens also reset the clock, so that time-restricted feeding (RF) dictates rhythms in peripheral tissues, whereas calorie restriction (CR) affects the SCN clock. To better understand the influence of RF vs. CR on circadian rhythms, we took advantage of the transgenic alphaMUPA mice that exhibit spontaneously reduced eating, and can serve as a model for CR under ad libitum feeding, and a model for temporal CR under RF compared with wild type (WT) mice. Our results show that RF advanced and generally increased the amplitude of clock gene expression in the liver under LD in both mouse types. However, under disruptive light conditions, RF resulted in a different clock gene phase in WT mice compared with alphaMUPA mice, suggesting a role for the reduced calories in resetting the SCN that led to the change of phase in alphaMUPA mice. Comparison of the RF regimen in the two lighting conditions in WT mice revealed that mPer1, mClock, and mBmal1 increased, whereas mPer2 decreased in amplitude under ultradian light in WT mice, suggesting a role for the SCN in determining clock gene expression in the periphery during RF.

Patients with eating disorders are also known to display impairments in inhibitory control, cognition and decision-making, which may promote and maintain binge eating symptomology. In the current study, we examined whether rats that were subsequently characterized as displaying a higher propensity to binge eat would show pre-existing deficits in reinforcer devaluation-a paradigm used to examine decision-making following reductions in the value of a food reinforcer. Female rats were first trained to respond on two levers for the delivery of two food reinforcers (sucrose and maltodextrin solutions). At the test stage, rats were provided 1h access to one of the two reinforcers to allow for devaluation via sensory specific satiety, immediately followed by an extinction test with both levers. Normal rats typically show reductions in responding on the lever associated with the devalued reinforcer (i.e., intact goal-directed responding). Subsequently, we used intermittent access to palatable food to identify high (BE prone [BEP]; n=14), intermediate (BE neutral [BEN]; n=48), and low (BE resistant [BER]; n=13) phenotypes of binge eating. Prior reinforcer devaluation performance showed BEN and BER rats suppressed responding on the lever associated with the devalued reinforcer while BEP rats did not. This insensitivity to instrumental reinforcer devaluation in BEP rats did not reflect impaired sensory-specific satiety as during a food choice test, BEP rats showed a more robust alteration in food preferences following devaluation. Additionally, across all rats sensory specific satiety was correlated with subsequent intake of palatable food. Collectively, these findings suggest dissociable effects of devaluation procedures on instrumental actions and consummatory behaviors in BEP rats, and may indicate that pre-existing differences in goal-directed behavior and sensory-specific satiety contribute to the propensity to overeat palatable food.","Reduced sensitivity to devaluation for instrumental but not consummatory behaviors in binge eating prone rats.","Physiology & behavior","LeMon JV and Sisk CL and Klump KL and Johnson AW","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,2021-03-17 01:05:05,1,2021-02-20 20:12:02,-1,2021-02-25 14:33:09,,,,,,,,

In contrast, in A(y) mice, 10 mg/kg AM251 decreased FI and BW gain while it did not influence WI. Food consumption of ob/ob and A(y) mice, as evidenced by feeding frequency (FF) and feeding duration (FD), was reduced by AM251 for 4-6 h. AM251 at these doses had no impact on the appetitive behavior or BW gain of lean mice. After a 1-week wash-out period, mice were given running wheels in their home cages. With running wheel exercise, lean and obese mice exhibited increased sensitivity to AM251. Low voluntary wheel running activity of ob/ob mice precluded detection of combined effects of AM251 and exercise in this genetic model of obesity. Lean and agouti mice given AM251 combined with exercise lost a greater amount of BW than with AM251 alone.

However, little is known regarding the relative contribution of habit, energy deficits and circadian pacemakers in the expression of feeding behavior. The aim of the present study was to investigate the involvement of, and interplay between, habit, pacemaker synchronization and energy deficits in the occurrence of dawn feeding in rats. Light onset exerts a strong control over the timing of dawn feeding. The motivation to feed at dawn persists even when access to food is prevented during this period, and shows accompanying shifts with changes in light onset. Rats compensate their caloric deficit imposed by food restriction at dawn by eating earlier in the light phase. This feeding probably occurs in response to feedback mechanisms signalling an energy deficit. The rapid shift in dawn feeding with changes in light onset and food restriction, and its quick reappearance after discontinuing food restriction, argue against habit formation as solely responsible for the occurrence and maintenance of dawn feeding. Habit formation does play a secondary role in the maintenance, but occurs within the 'boundaries' set by the pacemaker. These experiments show that the timing and maintenance of dawn feeding are under the control of a circadian pacemaker which can be shifted by light onset only.","Circadian pacemaker control of feeding in the rat, at dawn.","Physiology & behavior","Spiteri NJ and Prins AA and Keyser J and Strubbe JH","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-24 18:42:41,-1,2021-02-27 14:49:16,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, the motivation for this kind of diets in experimental diet-induced obesity models has not been well established. Our hypothesis is that obesity caused by a regular consumption of high-fat diet (HFD) occurs concomitantly with the inhibition of food reward. The ultimate goal of our study was to further analyze the extent to which the perception of food as an appetitive reinforcer is a necessary condition for obesity. METHODS: We have evaluated the influence of HFD on operant food self-administration (FSA) during a whole light-dark (12-12-h) cycle in mice that consumed HFD either during 1, 4 or 8 weeks. The study has been complemented by a two-bottle free-choice assay between tap water and sweetened drinks. RESULTS: These data show that both 4- and 8-week HFD treatments induced a significant decrease in operant FSA rate. Moreover, HFD impaired the sweetened-conditioned flavor preference in the two-bottle choice assay. CONCLUSION: Our results, showing a reduction in how hard an animal is willing to work for food reinforcers, provide evidence that chronic consumption of HFD negatively contributes to the incentive motivation to acquire food/drink reinforcers.

NALTX showed a greater anorexic effect during dark phase, whereas Mr2266 produced such effect during light phase. This suggests that mu-receptors play a major role during dark phase while kappa-receptors are more important in light phase. The comparison of effects of different opioidergic drugs in fasted and free-fed rats showed that NALTX and Mr2266 reduced the elevated basal food intake in 18-h fasted rats to free-fed control levels. Therefore, it appears that enhanced endogenous mu- and kappa-directed neural mechanisms are one of the factors responsible for enhancing food intake in fasted rats. Differential role of MOR and KCZ on food intake in free-fed and fasted rats is also indicated in our study. Both agonists produced a biphasic response in fasted rats, i.e., hyperphagia (0-1 h) followed by hypophagia (1-6 h). However, a generalized hyperphagic effect is observed in free-fed rats (except during 3-6 h by MOR). The initial hyperphagic effect is more prominent in fasted rats which may be due to additive effects of endopioid mechanisms. Specificity of the response at various intervals is confirmed by blockade with NALTX and Mr2266. NALTX appears more potent than Mr2266 in antagonising the effects of MOR but markedly less potent than Mr2266 in inhibiting the effects of KCZ. This suggests that both MOR and KCZ have a mu as well as kappa component in food intake response.","Role of diurnal variation and receptor specificity in the opioidergic regulation of food intake in free-fed and food-deprived rats.","Physiology & behavior","Gulati K and Ray A and Sharma KK","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-26 14:48:23,-1,2021-02-27 14:49:45,,,,,,,,

Methods: Male rats were permitted intermittent daily access (2 h / day) to a palatable HFHS chow diet for 28 days across adolescence. Social interaction, social memory and novel object recognition were assessed during this period. Following testing, RT-PCR was conducted on hippocampal and prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples. 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing was used for identification and relative quantification of bacterial taxa in faecal samples. Results: We observed reduced social interaction behaviours, impaired social memory and novel object recognition in HFHS diet rats compared to chow controls. RT-PCR revealed reduced levels of monoamine oxidase A (Maoa), catechol-O-methyltransferase (Comt) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) mRNA in the PFC of HFHS diet rats. Faecal microbiota analysis demonstrated that the relative abundance of a number of specific bacterial taxa differed significantly between the two diet groups, in particular, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminoccoceae bacteria.

Analysis of licking patterns suggested that bombesin and satiety operate by similar but not identical mechanisms. Deprivation reduction tended to decrease ingestion by reducing the rate of drinking and size of the first meal. Bombesin, by contrast, reduced the total duration of drinking and the number of meals taken, but had no effect on lick rate. Cumulative intake records suggested that bombesin reduces the volume threshold for termination of drinking such that intake continues at a normal rate below this threshold but ceases above it.

Such cue-food associations are encoded in sparse sets of neurons or 'neuronal ensembles' in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). For these ensemble-encoded, cue-controlled appetitive responses to remain adaptive, they must allow for their dynamic updating depending on acute changes in internal states such as physiological hunger or the perceived desirability of food. However, how these neuronal ensembles are recruited and physiologically modified following the update of such learned associations is unclear. To investigate this, we examined the effects of devaluation on ensemble plasticity at the levels of recruitment, intrinsic excitability, and synaptic physiology in sucrose-conditioned Fos-GFP mice that express green fluorescent protein (GFP) in recently activated neurons. Neuronal ensemble activation patterns and their physiology were examined using immunohistochemistry and slice electrophysiology, respectively. Reward-specific devaluation following 4 d of ad libitum sucrose consumption, but not general caloric devaluation, attenuated cue-evoked sucrose seeking. This suggests that changes in the hedonic and/or incentive value of sucrose, and not caloric need, drove this behavior. Moreover, devaluation attenuated the size of the neuronal ensemble recruited by the cue in the NAc shell. Finally, it eliminated the relative enhanced excitability of ensemble (GFP(+)) neurons against non-ensemble (GFP(-)) neurons observed under non-devalued conditions, and did not induce any ensemble-specific changes in excitatory synaptic physiology.

This is mediated, in part, by estradiol's ability to increase the strength by which negative-feedback signals function to inhibit meal size. For example, we recently reported that the anorectic effect of fenfluramine, a serotonin agonist, is enhanced during estrus. Here, we investigated whether a decrease in the strength of positive-feedback signals, like those related to the taste of food, contributes to the decrease in meal size observed either in estrous rats or following fenfluramine treatment. Rats were given brief access to six sucrose solutions (0.0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 M) and the mean number of licks to these solutions was monitored in diestrous and estrous rats treated with 1 mg/kg fenfluramine or saline vehicle. Following saline treatment, estrous rats displayed fewer licks than diestrous rats to the 0.025 M sucrose solution. Following fenfluramine treatment, a decrease in the number of licks to 3 of the 5 sucrose solutions was observed in diestrous rats only. This decrease in sucrose palatability was limited to brief access tests, as overnight preference for the 0.025 M sucrose solution was not decreased by fenfluramine in either diestrous or estrous rats. Our findings suggest that estrous rats experience a decrease in the strength of positive-feedback signals elicited by a dilute sucrose solution and that the anorectic effect of fenfluramine is associated with a decline in positive-feedback signaling in the diestrous rat.","Taste responses to dilute sucrose solutions are modulated by stage of the estrous cycle and fenfluramine treatment in female rats.","Physiology & behavior","Atchley DP and Weaver KL and Eckel LA","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 19:03:05,-1,2021-02-25 14:37:24,,,,,,,,

Exposure to stressful events in early life has strongly programs an individual's phenotype and adaptive capabilities. Until now, studies on programming and reversal strategies in early life stress animal models have been essentially limited to males. By using the perinatal stress (PRS) rat model (a model more sensitive to aging changes) in middle-aged females, we investigated the behavioral and endocrine responses following exposure in later life to an unpredictable chronic mild stress (uCMS) condition for six weeks. PRS by itself accelerated the ageing-related-disruption in the estrous cycle and led to reductions in the levels of estradiol. It also reduced motivational and risk-taking behavior in later life, with PRS females being characterized by a reduction in self-grooming in the splash test, in the exploration of the light compartment in the light/dark box test and in the time spent eating a palatable food in the novelty-induced suppression feeding test. PRS females showed impaired regulation of plasma glucose and insulin levels following a glucose challenge, with a hyperglycemic phenotype, and disrupted feedback of the HPA axis after acute stress with respect to controls. Remarkably, all PRS-induced alterations were modified by exposure to the uCMS procedure, thus resulting in a disease-dependent intervention; controls were not affected by uCMS, except for a slight and transient reduction in body weight, while PRS females displayed a reduced body weight gain for the entire duration of the uCMS procedure. Interestingly, the effects of uCMS on PRS females were still observed up to two months after its termination and the females displayed heightened rhythms of locomotor activity and enhanced sensitivity to reward with respect to controls exposed to uCMS. Our findings indicate that many parameters of the PRS female adult phenotype are shaped by both early and later life experiences in a non-additive way. As a consequence, early stressed individuals may be programmed with a more dynamic phenotype than non-stressed individuals.","Consequences of a double hit of stress during the perinatal period and midlife in female rats: Mismatch or cumulative effect?","Psychoneuroendocrinology","Van Camp G and Cigalotti J and Bouwalerh H and Mairesse J and Gatta E and Palanza P and Maccari S and Morley-Fletcher S","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-27 19:55:20,-1,2021-03-11 03:46:36,,,,,,,,

Using different reinforcement schedules, we evaluated whether HFD intake from weaning to adulthood modifies instrumental responding and induces a shift from goal-directed actions to habitual responding. We first observed reduced instrumental performance and motivation for a food reward in HFD-fed rats trained under schedules of reinforcement that facilitate habitual responding [Random Interval (RI)]. However, this deficit was alleviated if rats trained under RI were subsequently trained with reinforcement schedules that promote goal-directed strategies [Random Ratio (RR)]. Using an outcome devaluation procedure, we then demonstrated that consumption of a HFD promoted habitual behavior in rats trained under RI but not RR schedules. Finally, extended HFD exposure did not interfere with the ability of RR training to overcome impaired RI instrumental performance and to favor goal-directed behavior. These results indicate that chronic consumption of a HFD changes the co-ordination of goal-directed actions and habits and that alteration of food-seeking may be reversed under particular behavioral conditions.","The effect of high-fat diet consumption on appetitive instrumental behavior in rats.","Appetite","Tantot F and Parkes SL and Marchand AR and Boitard C and Naneix F and Laye S and Trifilieff P and Coutureau E and Ferreira G","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 19:05:38,-1,2021-02-25 14:38:43,,,,,,,,

Our previous studies have confirmed the adaptogenic and antistress properties of a single administration of R. rosea L. extract in rats exposed to acute stress. There is increasing evidence that prolonged exposure to stressful life events and depression are both related to significant behavioural, endocrinological and neurobiological changes in human and animal subjects. The aim of this study was to determine whether chronic treatment with a hydroalcoholic R. rosea extract (RHO) standardized in 3% rosavin and 1% salidroside can prevent alterations induced in female rats following 6 weeks of a chronic mild stress (CMS) procedure. This was analysed through the behavioural and physiological parameters of consumption of 1% sucrose solution, locomotor and exploratory activities, body weight gain and oestrous cycle length. After the first 3 weeks of stress, RHO was administered daily by gavage at doses of 10, 15 and 20 mg/kg for the remaining 3 weeks. In addition, the antidepressant drug fluoxetine (10 mg/kg os), which has been shown to reverse CMS-induced disruptions, was used as the reference treatment. Rats subjected to the CMS procedure demonstrated decreased sucrose intake, reduced moving behaviour, minimized weight gain and dysregulation of their oestrous cycle. Treatment with RHO completely reverted all of these changes. The effects of RHO were comparable to those of fluoxetine. Interestingly, neither RHO nor fluoxetine influence the behavioural and physiological parameters tested in non-stressed animals. These findings strongly showed that chronic administration of RHO results in potent inhibition of the behavioural and physiological changes induced by chronic exposure to mild stressors.","Effects of Rhodiola rosea L. extract on behavioural and physiological alterations induced by chronic mild stress in female rats.","Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)","Mattioli L and Funari C and Perfumi M","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 20:49:53,-1,2021-02-25 14:39:27,,,,,,,,

We have previously demonstrated that some rats within a strain are more susceptible to develop obesity than others when given free access to a high-fat diet. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that rats most susceptible to weight gain on a high-fat diet would also be most susceptible to weight gain as a consequence of weight cycling. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Rats were provided a low-fat diet (12% corn oil) for 2 weeks, then given a high-fat diet (45% corn oil) for 2 weeks to identify those most (obesity prone) and least (obesity resistant) susceptible to weight gain. Half of each group was then subjected to three 30-day cycles of food restriction (10 days) and refeeding (20 days) [weight cycler (WC) rats]. The other half were allowed free access to the high-fat diet [control (CO) rats]. All rats were then followed for an additional 10 weeks, with free access to the high-fat diet. RESULTS: When considering the entire 160 days of the study, we found no evidence that WC rats relative to CO rats had increased body weight, increased body fat content, or elevated energy efficiency. We found no evidence that rats most prone to dietary obesity were also prone to weight gain after weight cycling. During the weight cycling phase (days 1 to 90), weight cycled groups consumed less energy and gained less weight than controls. During the follow-up phase, WC and CO rats did not differ significantly in weight gain or energy intake.

Leptin is secreted by adipocytes in proportion to fat content, exhibits a daily rhythm in plasma that is synchronized to feeding time, and inhibits activity of arcuate neuropeptide Y neurons that stimulate feeding behavior and regulate metabolism. Activity within this neuropeptide Y system is enhanced by food deprivation and attenuated by overfeeding and diet-induced obesity. Diet-induced obesity, in turn, attenuates food-anticipatory rhythms. If the effects of obesity on food-entrained rhythms are mediated by leptin inhibition of neuropeptide Y neurons, then these rhythms may be enhanced in leptin-insensitive Zucker obese rats. Alternatively, if daily rhythms of leptin mediate the generation or entrainment of these rhythms, Zucker rats may fail to anticipate daily feedings. Zucker obese and lean rats received food for 3 h/day during the midlight period. Both groups exhibited significant food-anticipatory activity that persisted during three cycles of food deprivation, but this rhythm was significantly more robust in obese rats, when expressed as anticipation and persistence ratios, and as peak values. Anticipatory rhythms did not persist in either group when food was provided ad lib. These results indicate that central actions of leptin may mediate the inhibitory effects of obesity on the expression of food-anticipatory rhythms in rats, but do not mediate the inhibitory effects of ad lib food access, and do not serve as necessary internal entrainment cues or clock components for the food-entrainable circadian system.","Enhanced food-anticipatory circadian rhythms in the genetically obese Zucker rat.","Physiology & behavior","Mistlberger RE and Marchant EG","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc)",-1,,-1,2021-02-24 18:43:07,-1,2021-02-27 14:50:49,,,,,,,,

One component is entrained to the external light-dark cycle (Light Dependent Component, LDC) and thus has the same period, while the other has a period longer than 24 h (Non-Light Dependent Component, NLDC). This experiment examined whether RF can act on one or both of these two rhythms.

Studies are emerging that show multiple neurochemical and behavioral indices of addiction when animals overeat a fat-rich diet. The goal of the present study was to utilize liquid and solid diets high in sugar and fat content to determine whether opiate-like withdrawal is seen after binge consumption of these diets in Sprague-Dawley rats. Control groups were given ad libitum access to the sweet-fat food or standard chow. All rats were then given a battery of tests to measure signs of opiate-like withdrawal, which included somatic signs of distress, elevated plus-maze anxiety, and locomotor hypoactivity. Neither naloxone-precipitated (3 mg/kg) nor deprivation-induced withdrawal was observed in rats that were maintained on a nutritionally complete pelleted sweet-fat diet or a sweet, high-fat diet supplemented with standard rodent chow. Naloxone-precipitated withdrawal was also not seen in rats fed a liquid sweet-fat food. Further, body weight reduction to 85%, which is known to potentiate the reinforcing effects of substances of abuse, did not affect naloxone-precipitated signs of opiate-like withdrawal. Thus, unlike previous findings reported regarding rats with binge access to a sucrose solution, rats that binge eat sweet-fat combinations do not show signs of opiate-like withdrawal under the conditions tested. These data support the idea that excessive consumption of different nutrients can induce behaviors associated with addiction in different ways, and that the behaviors that could characterize 'food addiction' may be subtyped based on the nutritional composition of the food consumed.","Rats that binge eat fat-rich food do not show somatic signs or anxiety associated with opiate-like withdrawal: implications for nutrient-specific food addiction behaviors.","Physiology & behavior","Bocarsly ME and Berner LA and Hoebel BG and Avena NM","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-18 19:11:41,-1,2021-02-18 00:41:52,,,,,,,,

Brief periods (1-3 hr) of food deprivation, at the onset of the dark cycle, produced a significant decline in serum glucose levels and a simultaneous decrease in alpha 2-receptor binding sites, specifically in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) as opposed to other hypothalamic areas. Restoration of circulating glucose levels, by refeeding for 0.5 hr after 2.5 hr food deprivation or by administration of glucose to 1 hr food-deprived rats, prevented this decline in serum glucose, as well as the reduction in PVN alpha 2-noradrenergic receptor density.

In the present study, we explored both of these mechanisms by examining food anticipatory activity (FAA) in dopamine D2 receptor-overexpressing (D2R-OE) mice under various durations of food availability. First, we noted that at baseline, there were no differences between D2R-OE mice and their littermates in activity level, food intake, and body weight or in circadian activity. Under conditions of very restricted food availability (4 or 6 hr), both genotypes displayed FAA. In contrast, under 8-hr food availability, control mice showed FAA, but D2R-OE mice did not. Normalization of D2R by administration of doxycycline, a tetracycline analogue, rescued FAA under 8-hr restricted food. We next tested for circadian regulation of FAA. When given ad libitum access to food, neither D2R-OE nor controls were active during the daytime. However, after an interval of food restriction, all mice showed elevated locomotor activity at the time of previous food availability in the day, indicating circadian timing of anticipatory activity. In summary, motivation is reduced in D2R-OE mice but circadian timing behavior is not affected. We conclude that an increase in striatal D2R reduces FAA by modulating motivation and not by acting on a clock mechanism.","Overexpression of striatal D2 receptors reduces motivation thereby decreasing food anticipatory activity.","The European journal of neuroscience","LeSauter J and Balsam PD and Simpson EH and Silver R","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc),no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-27 19:50:01,-1,2021-03-11 03:43:39,,,,,,,,

The first experiment investigated the role of caloric content in resetting the feeding entrainable oscillator (FEO). Rats were entrained to 20 g chow/day until anticipatory activity was stable. The food access time was then delayed by 8 h and rats received either 0, 2, 6, or 16 g of chow for two days. Sixteen g of chow produced large delays on the next two cycles, while 0 and 2 g produced no delays. Two of 8 rats receiving 6 g showed delays, indicating that 22 kcal is near the threshold. In a second experiment, the effects of bulk were investigated. After an 8 h phase delay, rats received 0, 6, 10 or 16 g of chow mixed with cellulose for a total of 21 g for all groups. The 10 and 16 g chow groups delayed while the 0 g chow group did not. In the 6 g groups some animals phase shifted while others did not.

CUMS induced depressive-like behavior in rats, which was alleviated by acupuncture treatment. The increased levels of NO, PGE2, iNOS and COX-2 induced by CUMS, were all significantly decreased in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex by acupuncture. Moreover, acupuncture markedly inhibited the activation of NF-kappaB in rats.

In a double-blind placebo-controlled and randomized study, effects of human LHRH after acute (400 microg) and subchronic (800 microg/day over 2 weeks) intranasal administration were evaluated in 20 young and healthy men. Sexual desire and activity was assessed by a diary, ratings of women's attractiveness, a modified version of the Stroop colour naming task and a short term memory task. Effects on sexuality were contrasted with those on eating motivation and general neurocognitive functioning, the latter being assessed in addition by tasks of divergent thinking and a motor perseveration test. None of the measures of sexual desire and activity indicated any effect of LHRH, neither after acute nor after subchronic treatment. Unexpectedly, the diary indicated a significant increase in 'food intake' towards the end of the 14-day LHRH treatment. Enhanced colour naming performance on the Stroop task (independently of whether sex, food or neutral stimuli were used) in conjunction with an increased motor perseveration after LHRH points to a general effect on cognitive function towards stronger focussing of cortical processing.

Chronic stress increased anxiety in both males and females in different tasks during the dark phase, but not in the light phase. When tested during the dark, chronic stress decreased time and grid crossings in the center arena of the OF in males, whereas chronic stress decreased open arm entries and time in the EPM in females. For OF and EPM, an anxiety index calculation confirmed that chronic stress increased anxiety measures when taking into consideration locomotion metrics. For the FST and SP, chronic stress had a tendency to alter the immobility index and sucrose preference in both sexes, but did not reach statistical significance alone. Therefore, a separate z-score was computed for each task and summed to represent a combined z-score of depressive-like behavior. In the light phase, chronic stress increased depressive-like behavior in males, but decreased depressive-like behavior in females. Chronic stress had no statistically significant effects on depressive-like behavior in the dark phase, although the pattern of chronic stress effects on depressive-like behavior in females was similar for both light cycle phases.

Ad lib access in the restricted rats induced significant overeating on all three exposures. After all rats were returned to ad lib feeding, a 24h two-bottle saccharin/water choice test displayed significantly reduced saccharin consumption in the overeating rats, compared to those in the other 3 groups. To determine whether this avoidance was due to a learned association, a second experiment used a latent inhibition paradigm, familiarizing half the rats with the saccharin for 8 days prior to pairing it with overeating. Using the design of Experiment 1, with only the continuously ad lib and the restricted to ad lib feeding groups, it was found that the overeating-induced saccharin avoidance was attenuated by the pre-exposure.

Ghrelin is also an orexigenic and adipogenic hormone and is thought to be a signal to increase locomotor activity in anticipation of a scheduled meal. Although ghrelin is considered to be up-regulated during fasting, there are still conflicting data regarding the impact of starvation on ghrelin secretion. To test whether the secretory pattern of acylated ghrelin is altered during fasting, plasma levels were monitored every 20 min for 6 h in freely-behaving rats at the light/dark cycle transition, when animals initiate feeding and activity and use preferentially free fatty acids (FFA) as a source of energy. Rats were fed ad lib. or fasted at dark onset for 24, 48 or 72 h, with or without refeeding rate. The anticipatory rise in ghrelin levels, as well as home-cage activity at the onset of darkness, was significantly reduced from 48 h of fasting compared to ad lib. conditions. A delayed ghrelin peak, sensitive to renutrition, was observed in fasted animals. Although their motivation to eat appeared to be intact, rats fasted for 72 h showed the smallest compensatory refeeding rate after fasting, possibly reflecting altered gut function. Expression of agouti-related protein and neuropeptide Y, was significantly increased in 48- and 72-h fasted animals. Thus, following fasting, a blunted acylated ghrelin secretion at dark onset (i.e. a period when animals depend on FFA as a source of energy) is associated with reduced locomotor activity and refeeding and an up-regulation of anabolic neuropeptides. Such changes could be interpreted as compensatory mechanisms for helping to conserve energy under conditions where food is not available.","Meal anticipatory rise in acylated ghrelin at dark onset is blunted after long-term fasting in rats.","Journal of neuroendocrinology","Zizzari P and Hassouna R and Longchamps R and Epelbaum J and Tolle V","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 22:45:40,-1,2021-02-25 14:46:44,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of the FDA-approved medications pimavanserin, a 5-HT2AR antagonist/inverse agonist, and lorcaserin, a 5-HT2CR agonist, in a rodent model of binge eating. The effects of pimavanserin (0.3-3.0 mg/kg), lorcaserin (0.25-1.0 mg/kg), and the lowest effective dose of pimavanserin (0.3 mg/kg) plus lorcaserin (1.0 mg/kg) were tested in a high-fat food (HFF) intermittent access binge eating model in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 64). We assessed three measures related to binge eating - binge episode occurrence, binge intake, and weight gain associated with HFF access. Pimavanserin decreased binge intake and weight gain associated with HFF access, but did not prevent binge episode occurrence. Lorcaserin decreased binge intake, but did not prevent binge episode occurrence or weight gain associated with HFF access. Combined pimavanserin plus lorcaserin prevented binge episode occurrence in addition to decreasing binge intake and weight gain associated with HFF access. These preclinical findings in male rats suggest that pimavanserin and lorcaserin may be effective in treating patients with BED. Our studies further indicate that administration of one or both drugs may be more effective in certain sub-populations of patients with BED because of the unique profile each treatment elicits.

These brain oscillators are functionally coupled to coordinate the daily rhythm of food intake. In rats, a free choice high-fat high-sugar (fcHFHS) diet leads to a rapid increase of calorie intake and body weight gain. Interestingly, under a fcHFHS condition, rats ingest a similar amount of sugar during day time (rest phase) as during night time (active phase), but keep the rhythmic intake of regular chow-food. The out of phase between feeding patterns of regular (chow) and highly rewarding food (sugar) may involve alterations of brain circadian oscillators regulating feeding.

Purpose: The objective of this study was to identify whether chronic stress promotes food addiction or not and explore the possible mechanisms. Method: We applied adaily 2 hrsflashing LED irradiation stress to mice fed chow or palatable food to mimic the effect of chronic stress on feeding. After 1 month of chronic stress exposure, we tested their binge eating behaviors, cravings for palatable food, responses for palatable food, and compulsive eating behaviors to evaluate the effect of chronic stress on food addiction-like behaviors. We detected changes in the levels of various genes and proteins in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), ventral tegmental area (VTA) and lateral hypothalamus using qPCR and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. Results: Behaviors results indicated chronic stress obviously increased food addiction score (FAS) in the palatable food feeding mice. Moreover, the FAS had astrong relationship with the extent of the increase in body weight. Chronic stress increased the expression of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1(CRFR1) was increased in the NAc shell and core but decreased in the VTA of the mice fed with palatable food. Chronic stress also increased expression of both dopamine receptor 2 (DR2) and mu-opioid receptor (MOR) in the NAc. Conclusion: Chronic stress aggravates the FAS and contributed to the development of stress-related obesity. Chronic stress drives the dysregulation of the CRF signaling pathway in the reward system and increases the expression of DR2 and MOR in the nucleus accumbens.","Chronic stress increases susceptibility to food addiction by increasing the levels of DR2 and MOR in the nucleus accumbens.","Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment","Wei NL and Quan ZF and Zhao T and Yu XD and Xie Q and Zeng J and Ma FK and Wang F and Tang QS and Wu H and Zhu JH","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-15 15:32:30,-1,2021-01-29 22:15:28,,,,,,,,

The present study examined the expression of 15-PGDH in an animal model of depression. Depressive-like behaviors were measured after rats were exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). 15 PGDH mRNA and protein expression and activity and PGE2 levels were detected in the brain and lungs in stressed animals. The stressed animals exhibited decreases in body weight gain, locomotor activity in the open field, and sucrose preference. The hypothalamus and lungs had high baseline 15-PGDH mRNA and protein expression, whereas the frontal cortex and hippocampus showed no detectable 15-PGDH mRNA or protein expression. 15 PGDH mRNA and protein expression was significantly downregulated in the hypothalamus and lungs in stressed rats compared with control rats, and the enzymatic activity of 15-PGDH was correlated with protein expression levels. PGE2 concentrations in the brain and serum increased in stressed rats. These results suggest the loss of 15-PGDH expression in depression, and 15-PGDH may be a novel potential pharmacological target for the treatment of depression.","Chronic unpredictable mild stress induces parallel reductions of 15-PGDH in the hypothalamus and lungs in rats.","Behavioural brain research","Guo JY and Bian H and Yao Y","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-26 14:24:50,-1,2021-02-27 14:53:31,,,,,,,,
27630575,25400563,25400563,"","Eating depends strongly on learning processes which, in turn, depend on motivation. Conditioned learning, where individuals associate environmental cues with receipt of a reward, forms an important part of hedonic mechanisms; the latter contribute to the development of human overweight and obesity by driving excessive eating in what may become a vicious cycle. Although mice are commonly used to explore the regulation of human appetite, it is not known whether their conditioned learning of food rewards varies as a function of body mass. To address this, groups of adult male mice of differing body weights were tested two appetitive conditioning paradigms (pavlovian and operant) as well as in food retrieval and hedonic preference tests in an attempt to dissect the respective roles of learning/motivation and energy state in the regulation of feeding behavior. We found that (i) the rate of pavlovian conditioning to an appetitive reward develops as an inverse function of body weight; (ii) higher body weight associates with increased latency to collect food reward; and (iii) mice with lower body weights are more motivated to work for a food reward, as compared to animals with higher body weights. Interestingly, as compared to controls, overweight and obese mice consumed smaller amounts of palatable foods (isocaloric milk or sucrose, in either the presence or absence of their respective maintenance diets: standard, low fat-high carbohydrate or high fat-high carbohydrate). Notably, however, all groups adjusted their consumption of the different food types, such that their body weight-corrected daily intake of calories remained constant. Thus, overeating in mice does not reflect a reward deficiency syndrome and, in contrast to humans, mice regulate their caloric intake according to metabolic status rather than to the hedonic properties of a particular food. Together, these observations demonstrate that excess weight masks the capacity for appetitive learning in the mouse.","Altered motivation masks appetitive learning potential of obese mice.","Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience","Harb MR and Almeida OF","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 19:04:45,-1,2021-02-25 14:52:17,,,,,,,,

Food restriction increases the reinforcing properties and self-administration of many drugs of abuse. OBJECTIVE: The present study tested the hypotheses that (1) food restriction induces sensitization to the locomotor stimulation observed in response to methamphetamine and (2) a binge-like feeding schedule during food restriction produces increased sensitization compared to equally restricted mice fed in three daily meals. METHODS: Male DBA/2J mice were fed ad libitum or were food restricted to either an 8% or 16% loss of body weight. Additionally, the food-restricted mice were divided into two groups that were fed in either one meal (binge) or three equal-sized meals (meal). After the reduced body weight was stable, mice were tested for locomotor activity following saline and methamphetamine (1 mg/kg) injections. RESULTS: Both 16% body weight loss groups exhibited sensitization to methamphetamine. Opposite to our hypothesis, the 8% meal but not the 8% binge food-restricted group demonstrated locomotor sensitization. Serum corticosterone levels were significantly higher in the meal-fed groups when compared to the binge- and ad libitum-fed groups.

Diet-induced neuroadaptations within the dorsal striatum have the capacity to drive excessive food seeking and consumption. Five-week-old C57BL/6J mice consumed a high-fat, high-sugar 'western diet' (WD) or a control 'standard diet' (SD) for 16weeks. Weight gain, glucose tolerance, and insulin tolerance were measured to confirm an obese-like state. Following these 16weeks, electrophysiological recordings were made from medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the medial (DMS) and lateral (DLS) portions of dorsal striatum to evaluate diet effects on neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity. In addition, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry evaluated dopamine transmission in these areas. WD mice gained significantly more weight and consumed more calories than SD mice and demonstrated impaired glucose tolerance. Electrophysiology data revealed that MSNs from WD mice demonstrated increased AMPA-to-NMDA receptor current ratio and prolonged spontaneous glutamate-mediated currents, specifically in the DLS. Evoked dopamine release was also significantly greater and reuptake slower in both subregions of WD striatum. Finally, dorsal striatal MSNs from WD mice were significantly less likely to demonstrate mu-opioid receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity. Neuronal excitability and GABAergic transmission were unaffected by diet in either striatal subregion. Our results demonstrate that a high-fat, high-sugar diet alters facets of glutamate, dopamine, and opioid signaling within the dorsal striatum, with some subregion specificity.

We now report that RF also modifies the rhythms of PER2 expression in the central and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala and in the dentate gyrus, such that all three areas become synchronized, peaking 12 h after the time of food presentation. Daily limited access to sucrose or saccharine in freely fed rats or scheduled access to saline in sodium-deprived rats had no effect on these PER2 rhythms. Thus, it would appear that the rhythms of PER2 in limbic forebrain structures are sensitive to signals that arise from the alleviation of a negative metabolic state associated with scheduled feeding and that access to rewarding substances in the absence of food deprivation or metabolic challenges, per se, is not sufficient to alter the rhythms of PER2 expression in these regions.","Restricted access to food, but not sucrose, saccharine, or salt, synchronizes the expression of Period2 protein in the limbic forebrain.","Neuroscience","Waddington Lamont E and Harbour VL and Barry-Shaw J and Renteria Diaz L and Robinson B and Stewart J and Amir S","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc)",-1,,-1,2021-02-24 18:38:12,-1,2021-02-27 14:54:55,,,,,,,,

While living in cages that were exposed to a 12:12 light:dark cycle, rats were required to alternate leverpresses for their entire daily food ration. After a press on one lever resulted in the delivery of a food pellet, a red cuelight was illuminated for a fixed duration that equaled the imposed delay between successive leverpresses. After the imposed delay elapsed and the cuelight was turned off, a press on the alternate lever resulted in the delivery of another food pellet. Increases in the imposed delay from 0.01 s to 16 s reduced mean percent correct (alternation) and mean food intake, although both were reduced more rapidly and to a greater extent in the light than in the dark photoperiod. This interaction resulted from a reduction of meal size in the light and a compensatory increase in meal size in the dark as the imposed delay increased. Rats also defended their daily intake in the dark against increasingly larger imposed delays by spending increasingly larger amounts of time alternating and by increasing total (correct + incorrect) presses.

Three diet groups were used: ad libitum, dietary control, and 40% caloric restriction. Both dietary control and caloric restriction slightly reduced acute toxicity of high doses of chloral hydrate and potentiated the induction of hepatic enzymes associated with peroxisome proliferation.

Cell proliferation in glandular stomach and liver tissues was inhibited in rats DR for 24 months; however, cell proliferation in duodenum and forestomach mucosal tissues was unexpectedly enhanced by DR. These results indicated that while DR inhibits cell proliferation in tissues of rats, it is tissue-dependent.

While electrophysiology revealed complex task-related dynamics across neurons, population calcium was enhanced during approach and inhibited during consumption in both pathways.

We studied the role of these hormones in stress-induced reinstatement of food seeking and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neuronal activation in c-fos-GFP transgenic female rats, which express GFP in strongly activated neurons. Food-restricted ovariectomized or sham-operated c-fos-GFP rats were trained to lever-press for palatable food pellets. Subsequently, lever-pressing was extinguished and reinstatement of food seeking and mPFC neuronal activation was assessed after injections of the pharmacological stressor yohimbine (0.5-2 mg/kg) or pellet priming (1-4 noncontingent pellets). Estrous cycle effects on reinstatement were also assessed in wild-type rats. Yohimbine- and pellet-priming-induced reinstatement was associated with Fos and GFP induction in mPFC; both reinstatement and neuronal activation were minimally affected by ovarian hormones in both c-fos-GFP and wild-type rats. c-fos-GFP transgenic rats were then used to assess glutamatergic synaptic alterations within activated GFP-positive and nonactivated GFP-negative mPFC neurons following yohimbine-induced reinstatement of food seeking. This reinstatement was associated with reduced AMPA receptor/NMDA receptor current ratios and increased paired-pulse facilitation in activated GFP-positive but not GFP-negative neurons. While ovarian hormones do not appear to play a role in stress-induced relapse of food seeking in our rat model, this reinstatement was associated with unique synaptic alterations in strongly activated mPFC neurons.

Here we show that temporal feeding restriction under light-dark or dark-dark conditions can change the phase of circadian gene expression in peripheral cell types by up to 12 h while leaving the phase of cyclic gene expression in the SCN unaffected. Hence, changes in metabolism can lead to an uncoupling of peripheral oscillators from the central pacemaker. Sudden large changes in feeding time, similar to abrupt changes in the photoperiod, reset the phase of rhythmic gene expression gradually and are thus likely to act through a clock-dependent mechanism. Food-induced phase resetting proceeds faster in liver than in kidney, heart, or pancreas, but after 1 wk of daytime feeding, the phases of circadian gene expression are similar in all examined peripheral tissues.","Restricted feeding uncouples circadian oscillators in peripheral tissues from the central pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus.","Genes & development","Damiola F and Le Minh N and Preitner N and Kornmann B and Fleury-Olela F and Schibler U","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc)",-1,,-1,2021-02-26 14:30:22,-1,2021-02-27 14:56:31,,,,,,,,

Thus, there are two circadian rhythms, one of which is SCN-dependent and the other SCN-independent. Recently, it has been established that several mouse clock genes, such as mPer1, mPer2 and mPer3 are expressed in the SCN and other brain tissues. Although the role of mPer genes expressed in the SCN has recently been evaluated in the SCN-dependent rhythm, their function in the SCN-independent rhythm is still poorly understood. In order to understand the role of these genes in SCN-independent rhythm, we examined the expression pattern of mPer1 and mPer2 mRNA in each brain area of mice under RF. Mice were allowed access to food for 4 h during either the daytime under a light-dark cycle or the subjective daytime under constant dark. After 6 days of scheduled RF, the night-time or subjective night-time peak of mPer mRNA changed to a daytime peak in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, with moderate expression in the striatum, pyriform cortex and paraventricular nucleus, and no expression in the SCN. The daytime peak in the cerebral cortex returned to a night-time peak after the release of RF to a free-feeding schedule. Although the basal rhythm of mPer expression disappeared in SCN-lesioned mice, RF produced mPer mRNA rhythm in the cerebral cortex of these mice. The present results provide evidence of an association between food-entrainable oscillations and the expression of mPer1 and mPer2 in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus.","Restricted-feeding-induced anticipatory activity rhythm is associated with a phase-shift of the expression of mPer1 and mPer2 mRNA in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus but not in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of mice.","The European journal of neuroscience","Wakamatsu H and Yoshinobu Y and Aida R and Moriya T and Akiyama M and Shibata S","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc)",-1,,-1,2021-02-18 19:10:43,-1,2021-02-18 00:39:31,,,,,,,,

Circular, horizontal cuts (1.0 mm radius) were placed immediately above the anterior ARC to sever afferents to the PVN. In shams the knife was lowered to the same coordinates but was not rotated. Food intake and body weight were monitored twice daily, at the beginning and end of the light cycle, for 1 week. On the final day the animals were restrained for 30 min. Lesioned animals had increased food intake in light and dark periods, higher weight gain per day, and more body fat as compared with shams. There was no difference in caloric efficiency. Unlike shams, lesioned rats had no predictable relationship between plasma insulin and leptin. Plasma ACTH was increased at 0 min in lesioned rats but was decreased 15 and 30 min after restraint as compared with shams. There was no difference in plasma corticosterone. Immunostaining revealed that alpha-melanocortin (alphaMSH) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) accumulated below the cuts, and both were decreased in PVN. Food intake and body weight were correlated negatively to alphaMSH, but not NPY in PVN. There was no difference in proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA, but NPY mRNA was reduced in the ARC of lesioned animals.

The location of FEOs generating food anticipation rhythms, and the pathways that entrain these FEOs, remain to be clarified. To gain insight into entrainment pathways, we developed a protocol for measuring phase shifts of anticipatory activity rhythms in response to pharmacological probes. We used this protocol to examine a role for dopamine signaling in the timing of circadian food anticipation. To generate a stable food anticipation rhythm, rats were fed 3h/day beginning 6-h after lights-on or in constant light for at least 3 weeks. Rats then received the D2 agonist quinpirole (1 mg/kg IP) alone or after pretreatment with the dopamine synthesis inhibitor alpha-methylparatyrosine (AMPT). By comparison with vehicle injections, quinpirole administered 1-h before lights-off (19h before mealtime) induced a phase delay of activity onset prior to the next meal. Delay shifts were larger in rats pretreated with AMPT, and smaller following quinpirole administered 4-h after lights-on. A significant shift was not observed in response to the D1 agonist SKF81297.

The Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat strain is prone to develop anxiety and addiction-like behavior; nevertheless, a lack of information regarding their vulnerability to develop sugar binging-like behavior (SBLB) and how it affects the reward system persist. Therefore, the first aim of the present study was to compare the different predisposition of two rat strains, Wistar (W) and WKY to develop the SBLB in female and male rats. Also, we studied if the SBLB-inducing protocol produces changes in anxiety-like behavior using the plus-maze test (PMT) and, analyzed serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) concentrations in brain areas related to anxiety and ingestive behavior (brain stem, hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, and amygdala). Finally, we evaluated whether fluoxetine, a drug that has been effective in reducing the binge-eating frequency, body weight, and severity of binge eating disorder, could also block this behavior. Briefly, WKY and W female rats were exposed to 30% sucrose solution (2 h, 3 days/week for 4 weeks), and fed up ad libitum. PMT was performed between the last two test periods. Immediately after the last test where sucrose access was available, rats were decapitated and brain areas extracted for high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. The results showed that both W and WKY female and male rats developed the SBLB. WKY rats consumed more calories and ingested a bigger amount of sucrose solution than their W counterpart. This behavior was reversed by using fluoxetine, rats exposed to the SBLB-inducing protocol presented a rebound effect during the washout period. On female rats, the SBLB-inducing protocol induced changes in NA concentrations on WKY, but not on W rats. No changes were found in 5-HT levels. Finally, animals that developed SBLB showed increased anxiety-like behavior in the PMT.

The activity onset and offset of the locomotor rhythm were used for the phase reference. In blinded pups born and raised under ad libitum feeding, the phase at weaning was a function of the free-running period measured after weaning and located in a narrow range (control zone). When RF was imposed from 2 wk prior to the conception (C) until weaning (3w), the pups phases were located outside the control zone and related to the feeding time. To identify the period in which the phase setting is effective, RF was imposed during 5 different periods (C-0w, C-1w, C-2w, 2-6w, and 3-6w).

Affective disorders are typically associated with disruption of this fine-tuned 'internal synchronization,' but whether this internal misalignment is part of the physiopathology of mood disorders is not clear. To date, depressive-like behavior in animal models has been induced by methods that fail to specifically target the SCN regulation of internal synchronization as the mode to generate depression. In the rat, exposure to a 22-h light-dark cycle (LD22) leads to the uncoupling of two distinct populations of neuronal oscillators within the SCN. This genetically, neurally, and pharmacologically intact animal model represents a unique opportunity to assess the effect of a systematic challenge to the central circadian pacemaker on phenotypic manifestations of mood disorders. We show that LD22 circadian forced desynchrony in rats induces depressive-like phenotypes including anhedonia, sexual dysfunction, and increased immobility in the forced swim test (FST), as well as changes in the levels and turnover rates of monoamines within the prefrontal cortex. Desynchronized rats show increased FST immobility during the dark (active) phase but decreased immobility during the light (rest) phase, suggesting a decrease in the amplitude of the normal daily oscillation in this behavioral manifestation of depression.

To further evaluate this hypothesis, we measured clock gene, temperature and activity rhythms in intact and DMH-ablated mice. A single 4-h midday feeding after an overnight fast induced mPer1 and mPer2 mRNA expression in the DMH, arcuate nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract and area postrema, and reset daily rhythms of mPer1, mPer2 and mBMAL1 in the DMH, arcuate and neocortex. These rhythms persisted during 2 days of food deprivation after 12 days of scheduled daytime feeding. Acute induction of DMH mPer1 and mPer2 was N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent, whereas rhythmic expression after 6 days of restricted feeding was not. Thermal DMH lesions did not affect acute induction or rhythmic expression of clock genes in other brain regions in response to scheduled daytime feeding. DMH lesions attenuated mean daily activity levels and nocturnality but did not affect food-anticipatory rhythms of activity and body temperature in either light-dark or constant darkness. These results confirm that the DMH and other brain regions express circadian clock gene rhythms sensitive to daytime feeding schedules, but do not support the hypothesis that DMH oscillations drive food-anticipatory behavioral or temperature rhythms.","The dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus is not necessary for food-anticipatory circadian rhythms of behavior, temperature or clock gene expression in mice.","The European journal of neuroscience","Moriya T and Aida R and Kudo T and Akiyama M and Doi M and Hayasaka N and Nakahata N and Mistlberger R and Okamura H and Shibata S","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-26 14:17:54,-1,2021-02-27 15:10:19,,,,,,,,

The aim of the current study was to examine the role of the brain noradrenergic system in binge-like eating through the use of the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin. METHODS: For this purpose, we employed a limited access model whereby male Wistar rats were allowed to nosepoke for either chow (Chow rats) or a sugary, highly palatable food (Palatable rats) for 1 h/day. The effects of prazosin (0, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg, i.p.) were tested in a fixed ratio 1 (FR1) and progressive ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement. RESULTS: The results show that prazosin preferentially reduced the responses for palatable food in a FR1 reinforcement schedule; when tested in a PR schedule of reinforcement, prazosin increased breakpoint in both Chow and Palatable rats, but more potently and more efficaciously in the latter. Our results suggest that prazosin treatment preferentially increased the motivational properties of the palatable diet. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings provide the characterization of the effects of prazosin on binge-like eating and offer support to the existing literature showing the important role of the noradrenergic system in addiction-like behavior.","The Alpha-1 Adrenergic Receptor Antagonist Prazosin Reduces Binge-Like Eating in Rats.","Nutrients","Hicks C and Sabino V and Cottone P","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 19:24:58,-1,2021-02-25 14:57:42,,,,,,,,

In female Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), low circulating levels of ovarian steroids are associated with increased food hoarding and decreased sexual motivation, but these effects are exaggerated in food-restricted females. To determine whether cold ambient temperature has the same effects as food restriction, groups of hamsters were fed ad libitum while they were housed at either 5 degrees C or 22 degrees C, and then tested for behavior for 90 min on each day of the estrous cycle. In females housed at 22 degrees C, high levels of sexual motivation and low levels of food hoarding were seen every day of the estrous cycle. In females housed at 5 degrees C, high levels of sexual motivation were restricted to the periovulatory day. On the three nonestrous days, these females showed high levels of food hoarding, but not food intake. A separate cohort of females were provided with access to running wheels and housed at 22 degrees C. They showed high levels of sexual motivation restricted to the periovulatory day, similar to the pattern of sexual motivation seen in cold-housed females. Unlike cold-housed females, those with running wheels showed low levels of food hoarding and high levels of food intake. Food restriction, cold housing, and access to wheels had no significant effect on plasma estradiol or progesterone concentrations, but significantly decreased plasma leptin concentrations.

This dysfunction is not anecdotic since it might worsen the negative effects of obesity by promoting the overconsumption of energy-dense foods. Previous studies have highlighted a progressive devaluation of reward value of lipid stimuli due to a desensitization of dopaminergic brain areas in DIO mice. Paradoxically, the putative deleterious impact of obesity on peripheral fat detection by the gustatory papillae remains poorly documented. Using a whole transcriptomic investigation of the circumvallate papillae (CVP), an analysis of CVP genes involved in fat taste transduction and signaling along the day, and two bottle choice tests, we have found that (i) CVP, known to house the most taste buds in the oral cavity, displays a genic circadian rhythm, (ii) DIO reduces the oscillation of key genes involved both in the circadian clock and lipid detection/signaling, and (iii) the gene invalidation of the clock gene Rev-Erbalpha does not significantly affect fat preference despite an oily solution intake slightly lower than littermate controls. Taken together these data bring the first demonstration that the gustatory function is under control of a peripheral clock in mammals, as already reported in fly and suggest that a disturbance of this rhythmicity might contribute to the lower fatty taste acuity found in obese mice.","Diet-Induced Obesity Alters the Circadian Expression of Clock Genes in Mouse Gustatory Papillae.","Frontiers in physiology","Bernard A and Dastugue A and Maquart G and Delhaye S and Duez H and Besnard P","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 23:18:42,-1,2021-02-25 14:58:24,,,,,,,,

This interpretation suggests that cognitive adaptations may surpass physiological regulations of metabolic needs after recurrent cycles of dieting and binging. Intermittent access to palatable food has long been studied in rats, but the consequences of such diet cycling procedures on the cognitive control of food seeking remain unclear. Female Wistar rats were divided in two groups matched for food intake and body weight. One group received standard chow pellets 7 days/week, whereas the second group was given chow pellets for 5 days and palatable food for 2 days over seven consecutive weeks. Rats were also trained for operant conditioning. Intermittent access to palatable food elicited binging behavior and reduced intake of normal food. Rats with intermittent access to palatable food failed to exhibit anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated plus maze, but displayed reduced locomotor activity in the open field and developed a blunted corticosterone response following an acute stress across the diet procedure. Trained under a progressive ratio schedule, both groups exhibited the same motivation for sweetened food pellets. However, in contrast to controls, rats with a history of dieting and binging exhibited a persistent compulsive-like behavior when access to preferred pellets was paired with mild electrical foot shock punishments.

This anticipatory behavior is not observed when rodents are allowed ad libitum food access and reappears for several cycles when food-entrained animals are fasted. Previously we reported that food entrainment also produces increased expression of c-Fos protein in the dorsomedial nucleus (DMH), in the perifornical area (PeF) and in the lateral hypothalamic area (LH) anticipating food intake. These hypothalamic structures contain abundant orexin (ORX) producing neurons and promote arousal, reward and metabolic balance, thus we explored the participation of the orexinergic system in food-entrainment by evaluating in food entrained rats (RF) the expression of c-Fos in ORX cells in anticipation, during and after food access, and in rats exhibiting persistent activation in fasting after interruption of the food-entrainment protocol (RF-Fast). Data were compared with ad libitum controls and with a 22-h fasted group. RF rats exhibited a food-entrained rhythm of c-Fos in ORX cells in the DMH, LH and PeF with highest levels at the time of meal delivery and after food ingestion. In RF-Fast rats the food-entrained pattern of ORX cells persisted in the PeF and LH and partially in the DMH, which in addition exhibited an earlier activation. We conclude that ORX cells in PeF and LH exhibit self sustained oscillations driven by food-entrainment, whereas the DMH may mediate arousal mechanisms that elicit anticipatory activity.","Food-entrained patterns in orexin cells reveal subregion differential activation.","Brain research","Jimenez A and Caba M and Escobar C","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc)",-1,,-1,2021-02-24 19:22:46,-1,2021-02-27 15:11:50,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, because triamcinolone causes loss of body mass and muscle wasting, the effects of triamcinolone were investigated relative to a control group, with the same loss of body mass, due to nutritional deprivation. The study was performed in male Wistar rats in the following treatment groups: TR, triamcinolone treatment (0.25 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) for 2 weeks), which resulted in a reduction of body mass (24%); ND, nutritional deprivation (30% of normal daily food intake for 2 weeks) resulting in a similar (24%) decrease of body mass as TR; PR, prednisolone treatment (0.31 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) for 2 weeks), with a 10% increase in body mass; FF, free-fed control group, with a 12% increase in body mass in 2 weeks.

These experiments utilized a novel variant of the conditioned place preference task (CPP) that is normally used to assess Pavlovian associative learning and memory processes produced via repeated context-reward pairings. For the present experiments, the standard CPP paradigm was modified in that both contexts were paired with food, but the dietary constituents of the food were different. In particular, we were interested in whether rats could differentiate between two types of carbohydrates, simple (dextrose) and complex (starch). Consumption rates for each type of carbohydrate were measured throughout training. A test of context preference without the food present was also conducted. At the end of behavioral testing, a fasting glucose test and a glucose challenge test were administered. Chronic photoperiod shifting resulted in impaired context learning and memory processes thought to be mediated by a neural circuit centered on the hippocampus. The results also showed that preferences for the different carbohydrate diets were altered in rats experiencing photoperiod shifting in that they maintained an initial preference for the simple carbohydrate throughout training. Lastly, photoperiod shifting resulted in changes in fasting blood glucose levels and elicited weight gain.

Here, we examined whether the MCH system plays a role both in caloric and motivational aspects of sugar intake. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The non-peptide MCH1-R antagonist GW803430 (3, 10, 30 mg/kg, i.p.) was first tested on self-administration under a fixed ratio schedule of reinforcement of both a caloric (10% w/v sucrose) and a non-caloric (0.06% w/v saccharin) sweet solution. GW803430 was then tested for its ability to alter motivational properties and seeking of sucrose. Lastly, the drug was tested to concurrently examine its effects on the escalated consumption of both sugar and food in animals following intermittent sugar access. RESULTS: The MCH1-R antagonist reduced sucrose- but not saccharin-reinforced lever pressing, likely reflecting a decreased appetite for calories in GW803430-treated rats. GW803430 reduced sucrose self-administration under a progressive ratio schedule, and suppressed cue-induced reinstatement of sucrose seeking, suggesting effects on rewarding properties of sucrose. GW803430 attenuated food intake in rats on intermittent access to sucrose at all doses examined (3, 10, 30 mg/kg), while reduction of sugar intake was weaker in magnitude. CONCLUSION: Together, these observations support an involvement of the MCH system in regulation of energy balance as well as mediation of sucrose reward. MCH may be an important regulator of sugar intake by acting on both caloric and rewarding components.","Melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCH1-R) antagonism: reduced appetite for calories and suppression of addictive-like behaviors.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior","Karlsson C and Zook M and Ciccocioppo R and Gehlert DR and Thorsell A and Heilig M and Cippitelli A","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 18:51:08,-1,2021-02-25 14:59:56,,,,,,,,

We previously identified cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 2 (Cyfip2) as a genetic factor underlying compulsive-like BE in mice. CYFIP2 is a homolog of CYFIP1 which is one of four paternally-deleted genes in patients with Type I Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), a neurodevelopmental disorder whereby 70% of cases involve paternal 15q11-q13 deletion. PWS symptoms include hyperphagia, obesity (if untreated), cognitive deficits, and obsessive-compulsive behaviors. We tested whether Cyfip1 haploinsufficiency (+/-) would enhance compulsive-like behavior and palatable food (PF) intake in a parental origin- and sex-dependent manner on two Cyfip2 genetic backgrounds, including the BE-prone C57BL/6N (Cyfip2 (N/N)) background and the BE-resistant C57BL/6J (Cyfip2 (J/J)) background. Cyfip1 (+/-) mice showed increased compulsive-like behavior on both backgrounds and increased PF intake on the Cyfip2 (N/N) background. In contrast, maternal Cyfip1 haploinsufficiency on the BE-resistant Cyfip2 (J/J) background induced a robust escalation in PF intake in wild-type Cyfip1 (J/J) males while having no effect in Cyfip1 (J/-) males. Notably, induction of behavioral phenotypes in wild-type males following maternal Fmr1 (+/-) has previously been reported. In the hypothalamus, there was a paternally-enhanced reduction in CYFIP1 protein whereas in the nucleus accumbens, there was a maternally-enhanced reduction in CYFIP1 protein. Nochange in FMR1 protein (FMRP) was observed in Cyfip1 (+/-) mice, regardless of parental origin. To summarize, Cyfip1 haploinsufficiency increased compulsive-like behavior and induced genetic background-dependent, sex-dependent, and parent-of-origin-dependent effects on PF consumption and CYFIP1 expression that could have relevance for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.","Cyfip1 Haploinsufficiency Increases Compulsive-Like Behavior and Modulates Palatable Food Intake in Mice: Dependence on Cyfip2 Genetic Background, Parent-of Origin, and Sex.","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)","Babbs RK and Beierle JA and Ruan QT and Kelliher JC and Chen MM and Feng AX and Kirkpatrick SL and Benitez FA and Rodriguez FA and Pierre JJ and Anandakumar J and Kumar V and Mulligan MK and Bryant CD","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-18 19:16:12,-1,2021-02-18 00:44:50,,,,,,,,

However, neural mechanisms mediating the motivation for food consumption are not fully understood. Food impacts the brain-rewarding-system via both oral-sensory and post-ingestive information. Recent studies have reported an important role of visceral gut information in mediating dopamine (DA) release in the brain rewarding system. This is independent of oral sensation, suggesting a role of the gut-brain-DA-axis in feeding behavior. In this study, we investigated the effects of intra-gastric (IG) self-administration of glucose on neuronal firings in the nucleus accumbens (NA) of water-deprived rats. Rats were trained in an operant-licking paradigm. During training, when the light was on for 2 min (light-period), rats were required to lick a spout to acquire the water oral-intake learning, and either an IG self-infusion of 0.4 M glucose (GLU group) or water (H2O group). Rats rested in the dark-period (3 min) following the light-period. Four cycles of the operant-licking paradigm consisting of the light-dark periods were performed per day, for 4 consecutive days. In the test session, the same rats licked the same spout to acquire the IG self-administration of the corresponding solutions, without oral water ingestion (dry licking). Behavioral results indicated IG self-administration of glucose elicits more dry-licking behavior than that of water. Neurophysiological results indicated in the dark period, coefficient of variance (CV) measuring the inter-spike interval variability of putative medial spiny neurons (pMSNs) in the NA was reduced in the H2O group compared to the GLU group, while there was no significant difference in physical behaviors in the dark period between the two groups. Since previous studies reported that DA release increases CV of MSNs, the present results suggest that greater CV of pMSNs in the GLU group reflects greater DA release in the NA and elevated motivation in the GLU group, which might increase lickings in the test session in the GLU group compared to the H2O group.","Rewarding Effects of Operant Dry-Licking Behavior on Neuronal Firing in the Nucleus Accumbens Core.","Frontiers in pharmacology","Patrono E and Matsumoto J and Nishimaru H and Takamura Y and Chinzorig IC and Ono T and Nishijo H","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 22:46:51,-1,2021-02-25 15:00:22,,,,,,,,

Nine days of fluoxetine treatment eliminated sexual receptivity and proceptivity (hops/darts) in 40% and 46%, respectively, of rats without altering the estrous cycle. Female rats then received a 10th fluoxetine injection 30 min prior to assessment of sexual motivation (measured with the male preference paradigm). There was no effect of fluoxetine on male preference, but fluoxetine significantly reduced the number of crossings and seconds of grooming during preference testing. Therefore, effects of fluoxetine on estrous cyclicity and behavior of Sprague Dawley female rats were smaller and required longer to develop than previously reported in Fischer female rats. These findings reinforce a probable relationship between fluoxetine's effect on sexual activity and neuroendocrine disturbances and illustrate the importance of strain selection in attempting to model human disease.","Modest effects of repeated fluoxetine on estrous cyclicity and sexual behavior in Sprague Dawley female rats.","Brain research","Maswood N and Sarkar J and Uphouse L","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc),no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-18 19:17:15,-1,2021-02-18 00:47:14,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to further investigate the mechanisms by which memantine influences the motivational aspects of ingestion through the analysis of licking microstructure. To interpret treatment effects in relation to drug action at specific functionally relevant times, we compared the effect of two different administration schedules. METHODS: Memantine was administered daily for a week, either 1 h before or immediately after a 30-min daily session. The effects on the microstructure of licking for a 10% sucrose solution in rats were examined in the course of treatment and for 15 days after treatment discontinuation. RESULTS: Treatment before testing reduced ingestion due to reduced burst size and increased latency in the first session. However, a progressive increase in burst number across sessions led to a full recovery of ingestion levels by the end of treatment. Daily post-session administration induced a dramatic decrease of activation of licking behaviour, indicated by reduced burst number, accompanied to reduced burst size. A slow recovery of ingestion took place after treatment discontinuation. CONCLUSION: These results suggest a reduced hedonic/reward evaluation response, an effect likely due to NMDA receptor blockade occurring during the testing time and support the hypothesis that memantine interferes with the hedonic/non-homeostatic mechanisms regulating food intake and food-seeking. The effect of post-session administration might be explained by the development of conditioned taste aversion.","Daily memantine treatment blunts hedonic response to sucrose in rats.","Psychopharmacology","Galistu A and D'Aquila PS","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 22:51:54,-1,2021-02-25 15:01:04,,,,,,,,

In this report, inhibition of food intake was compared in male and female rats following 1 h of restraint, electric footshock, or emotional stress induced by a communication box. Although the three stressors inhibited food intake in both genders, only emotional stress caused a gender difference, a greater inhibition of food intake in female rats (48%) than in male rats (22%). The inhibition of food intake by emotional stress in female rats was more prominent during proestrus than the other phases of estrous cycle. In female rats in proestrus emotional stress showed a greater inhibition of food intake than footshock and restraint. Ovariectomy reduced the inhibition of food intake by emotional stress to the same level as that in male, and replacement with estradiol restored the inhibition to the level of the normal female rats. A corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) type 1 receptor antagonist prevented emotional stress-induced inhibition of food intake, indicating the involvement of CRF type 1 receptor in emotional stress-induced inhibition of food intake.

Release into continuous darkness with ad libitum food, elicits immediate reversal of activity to the previous nocturnal phase, indicating that the classical circadian pacemaker maintained its phase to the light-dark cycle.

The hypoactivity is closely related with low frequency of glutamatergic signaling that is affected by the levels of Glu and Gln. Thus, we hypothesized that there might be a causality among low levels of Glu and Gln, hypoactive glutamatergic neurotransmissions, and depressive behaviors. Here, we found low Glu and Gln levels and low frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current (sEPSC) of glutamatergic neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of chronic immobilization stress (CIS)-induced depressed mice. The depressed mice also showed hypoactive Gln synthetase (GS). Inhibition of GS by methionine sulfoximine (MSO) decreased Glu and Gln levels and increased depressive behaviors with low frequency of sEPSC in the mPFC, indicating that Glu and Gln decrements cause hypoactive glutamatergic neurotransmissions and depressive behaviors. Both Glu and Gln could increase sEPSC of glutamatergic neurons in the mPFC on slice patch, but only Gln overcame MSO to increase sEPSC, suggesting that exogenous Gln would recover CIS-induced low frequency of sEPSC caused by hypoactive GS and act as an antidepressant. Expectedly, Gln supplementation showed antidepressant effects against CIS; it increased glutamatergic neurotransmissions with Glu and Gln increment in the mPFC and attenuated depressive behaviors. Moreover, selective glutamatergic activation in the mPFC by optogenetics decreased depressive behavior. In conclusion, depressive behaviors evoked by chronic stress were due to hypoactive glutamatergic neurons in the mPFC caused by low levels of Glu and Gln, and exogenous Gln can be used as an alternative antidepressant to increase glutamatergic neurotransmission.","Glutamine has antidepressive effects through increments of glutamate and glutamine levels and glutamatergic activity in the medial prefrontal cortex.","Neuropharmacology","Son H and Baek JH and Go BS and Jung DH and Sontakke SB and Chung HJ and Lee DH and Roh GS and Kang SS and Cho GJ and Choi WS and Lee DK and Kim HJ","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-27 21:07:39,-1,2021-03-12 00:57:21,,,,,,,,

No meal-anticipatory activity (AA) was observed in any of the dunnarts during the experiment. This contrasts with previous work where AA has been reported in dunnarts subjected to RF.

Evidence supporting this observation was the fact that 4/8 dunnarts' activity rhythms were entrained by RF, 2 showed relative coordination, and 1 exhibited bouncing phenomenon. In other species of marsupials and in rats, it has been proposed that RF entrains a food-entrainable pacemaker, which, in turn, entrains, via coupling, the suprachiasmatic-based, light-entrainable pacemaker. The findings of the present study differ from those reported previously in that no observable AA was entrained but the light-entrainable pacemaker was entrained by RF.

Most of the literature focuses on the mesolimbic nuclei as the core of reward behavior regulation. However, the lateral hypothalamus (LH) is also a key reward-control locus in the brain. Here we hypothesize that manipulating glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) activity selectively in the LH can profoundly affect food reward behavior, ultimately leading to obesity. Progressive ratio operant responding for sucrose was examined in male and female rats, following GLP-1R activation and pharmacological or genetic GLP-1R blockade in the LH. Ingestive behavior and metabolic parameters, as well as molecular and efferent targets, of the LH GLP-1R activation were also evaluated. Food motivation was reduced by activation of LH GLP-1R. Conversely, acute pharmacological blockade of LH GLP-1R increased food motivation but only in male rats. GLP-1R activation also induced a robust reduction in food intake and body weight. Chronic knockdown of LH GLP-1R induced by intraparenchymal delivery of an adeno-associated virus-short hairpin RNA construct was sufficient to markedly and persistently elevate ingestive behavior and body weight and ultimately resulted in a doubling of fat mass in males and females. Interestingly, increased food reinforcement was again found only in males. Our data identify the LH GLP-1R as an indispensable element of normal food reinforcement, food intake and body weight regulation. These findings also show, for we believe the first time, that brain GLP-1R manipulation can result in a robust and chronic body weight gain. The broader implications of these findings are that the LH differs between females and males in its ability to control motivated and ingestive behaviors.","Lateral hypothalamic GLP-1 receptors are critical for the control of food reinforcement, ingestive behavior and body weight.","Molecular psychiatry","Lopez-Ferreras L and Richard JE and Noble EE and Eerola K and Anderberg RH and Olandersson K and Taing L and Kanoski SE and Hayes MR and Skibicka KP","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 22:54:37,-1,2021-02-25 15:25:46,,,,,,,,

For instance, previous reports have shown that stimulating glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), an area that directs motivational processes towards food and drugs of abuse, has an anorectic effect. In contrast, micro-opioid receptor activation of the NAc increases feeding, particularly on highly palatable diets. While both neurotransmitters act within the NAc to impact food intake, it is not clear if and how they might interact to affect feeding. Therefore, these experiments tested the effects of NAc injections of the GLP-1 receptor agonist Exendin 4 (EX4) or antagonist Exendin 9 (EX9) on the consumption of a sweetened fat diet, with and without simultaneous micro-opioid receptor stimulation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 8/group, EX4 or EX9) underwent surgery to place bilateral cannula above the NAc core. After recovery, animals were tested following NAc injections of saline or the micro-opioid agonist [D-Ala, N-MePhe, Gly-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) (0.025 microg/side), combined with varying doses of EX4 (0, 0.05, or 0.10 microg/side) or EX9 (0, 2.5, 5.0 microg/side), counterbalanced across 6 testing days. Food and water intake, along with locomotor activity, was monitored for 2 h. Mu-opioid receptor stimulation significantly increased feeding, and this effect was reduced by GLP-1 receptor stimulation. In contrast, GLP-1 antagonism with EX9 altered the dynamics of DAMGO-induced binge-like feeding, extending micro-opioid-induced binging, and increasing food consumption.

The lipid-derived messenger oleoylethanolamide (OEA) acts as a satiety signal inhibiting food intake through the involvement of central noradrenergic and oxytocinergic neurons. We investigated the anti-binge effects of OEA in a rat model of binge-like eating, in which, after cycles of intermittent food restrictions/refeeding and palatable food consumptions, female rats show a binge-like intake of palatable food, following a 15-min exposure to their sight and smell ('frustration stress'). Systemically administered OEA dose-dependently (2.5, 5, and 10 mg kg(-1)) prevented binge-like eating. This behavioral effect was associated with a decreased activation (measured by mapping the expression of c-fos, an early gene widely used as a marker of cellular activation) of brain areas responding to stress (such as the nucleus accumbens and amygdala) and to a stimulation of areas involved in the control of food intake, such as the VTA and the PVN. These effects were paralleled, also, to the modulation of monoamine transmission in key brain areas involved in both homeostatic and hedonic control of eating. In particular, a decreased dopaminergic response to stress was observed by measuring dopamine extracellular concentrations in microdialysates from the nucleus accumbens shell, whereas an increased serotonergic and noradrenergic tone was detected in tissue homogenates of selected brain areas. Finally, a decrease in corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) mRNA levels was induced by OEA in the central amygdala, while an increase in oxytocin mRNA levels was induced in the PVN. The restoration of a normal oxytocin receptor density in the striatum paralleled the oxytocinergic stimulation produced by OEA. In conclusion, we provide evidence suggesting that OEA might represent a novel potential pharmacological target for the treatment of binge-like eating behavior.","Oleoylethanolamide decreases frustration stress-induced binge-like eating in female rats: a novel potential treatment for binge eating disorder.","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Romano A and Micioni Di Bonaventura MV and Gallelli CA and Koczwara JB and Smeets D and Giusepponi ME and De Ceglia M and Friuli M and Micioni Di Bonaventura E and Scuderi C and Vitalone A and Tramutola A and Altieri F and Lutz TA and Giudetti AM and Cassano T and Cifani C and Gaetani S","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 19:18:52,-1,2021-02-25 15:27:14,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: We observed a selective down-regulation of fatty acid amide hydrolase (faah) gene expression in the hypothalamus of rats showing the binge-eating behavior with a consistent reduction in histone 3 acetylation at lysine 4 of the gene promoter. No relevant changes were detected for any other endocannabinoid system components in any brain regions under study, as well as for the other epigenetic mechanisms investigated (DNA methylation and histone 3 lysine 27 methylation) at the faah gene promoter.

This learning was studied in rats trained on a single food or a choice between protein-rich and carbohydrate-rich foods, presented for 1.5 h after 3 h without maintenance food at the start of the dark phase. Eight training cycles provided a pseudo-random sequence of 3 h and 10 h post-prandial fasts with a day on maintenance food between each training fast. The measure of anticipatory hunger is the difference over one 4-day cycle between the intake of test food having an odour predictive of the longer fast (TL) and intake of food with an odour cuing to the shorter fast (TS). Previous experiments showed that conditioning of preference for the odour before the shorter fast competes with learning to avoid hunger during the longer fast (anticipatory hunger), generating a cubic or quartic contrast. TL minus TS showed a strong cubic trend over 8 training cycles with both single and choice meals. There was a switch from preference for the short-fast odour at cycle 2 (TL-TS=-0.86 g) to a peak of anticipatory hunger at cycle 6 (TL-TS=1.57 g). We conclude that anticipatory hunger is learnt when a choice is given between protein-rich and carbohydrate-rich foods as well as on a single food.

For example, prediction error (PE) models suggest a role of learning, while incentive salience (IS) models argue that the DA signal imbues stimuli with value and thereby stimulates motivated behavior. However, within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) patterns of DA release can strikingly differ between subregions, and as such, it is possible that these patterns differentially contribute to aspects of PE and IS. To assess this, we measured DA release in subregions of the NAc during a behavioral task that spatiotemporally separated sequential goal-directed stimuli. Electrochemical methods were used to measure subsecond NAc dopamine release in the core and shell during a well learned instrumental chain schedule in which rats were trained to press one lever (seeking; SL) to gain access to a second lever (taking; TL) linked with food delivery, and again during extinction. In the core, phasic DA release was greatest following initial SL presentation, but minimal for the subsequent TL and reward events. In contrast, phasic shell DA showed robust release at all task events. Signaling decreased between the beginning and end of sessions in the shell, but not core. During extinction, peak DA release in the core showed a graded decrease for the SL and pauses in release during omitted expected rewards, whereas shell DA release decreased predominantly during the TL. These release dynamics suggest parallel DA signals capable of supporting distinct theories of appetitive behavior. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Dopamine signaling in the brain is important for a variety of cognitive functions, such as learning and motivation. Typically, it is assumed that a single dopamine signal is sufficient to support these cognitive functions, though competing theories disagree on how dopamine contributes to reward-based behaviors. Here, we have found that real-time dopamine release within the nucleus accumbens (a primary target of midbrain dopamine neurons) strikingly varies between core and shell subregions. In the core, dopamine dynamics are consistent with learning-based theories (such as reward prediction error) whereas in the shell, dopamine is consistent with motivation-based theories (e.g., incentive salience). These findings demonstrate that dopamine plays multiple and complementary roles based on discrete circuits that help animals optimize rewarding behaviors.","Differential Dopamine Release Dynamics in the Nucleus Accumbens Core and Shell Reveal Complementary Signals for Error Prediction and Incentive Motivation.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Saddoris MP and Cacciapaglia F and Wightman RM and Carelli RM","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 22:47:24,-1,2021-02-25 15:30:41,,,,,,,,

Phase shifts following cold were not affected by food and water deprivation but were significantly attenuated by locking the wheel for 6 h beginning at cold onset (24 +/- 12 min).

In Part 2 the method is applied to IRT distributions from rats that obtained food pellets by nose poking a lighted key under various multiple schedules of reinforcement. As expected, total response rate increased as a function of (a) increasing the rate of reinforcement (i.e., variable-interval [VI] 4 min vs. VI 1 mi), (b) increasing the amount of the reinforcer (one food pellet vs. four pellets), (c) increasing the percentage of reinforcers that were contingent on nose poking (25% vs. 100%), and (d) requiring additional responses after the end of the VI schedule (i.e., adding a tandem variable-ratio [VR] 9 requirement). The first three of these variables (relative reinforcement) increased the visit-initiation rate. The tandem VR, in contrast, increased the number of responses per visit.

Although the underlying molecular oscillatory mechanism is well studied, factors that influence phenotypic plasticity in daily activity patterns (temporal niche switching, chronotype) are presently unknown. Molecular evidence suggests that metabolism may influence the circadian molecular clock, but evidence at the level of the organism is lacking. Here we show that a metabolic challenge by cold and hunger induces diurnality in otherwise nocturnal mice. Lowering ambient temperature changes the phase of circadian light-dark entrainment in mice by increasing daytime and decreasing nighttime activity. This effect is further enhanced by simulated food shortage, which identifies metabolic balance as the underlying common factor influencing circadian organization. Clock gene expression analysis shows that the underlying neuronal mechanism is downstream from or parallel to the main circadian pacemaker (the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus) and that the behavioral phenotype is accompanied by phase adjustment of peripheral tissues. These findings indicate that nocturnal mammals can display considerable plasticity in circadian organization and may adopt a diurnal phenotype when energetically challenged. Our previously defined circadian thermoenergetics hypothesis proposes that such circadian plasticity, which naturally occurs in nocturnal mammals, reflects adaptive maintenance of energy balance. Quantification of energy expenditure shows that diurnality under natural conditions reduces thermoregulatory costs in small burrowing mammals like mice. Metabolic feedback on circadian organization thus provides functional benefits by reducing energy expenditure.

The results of our first experiment revealed that 48 hr food deprivation reduced (by 50%) the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) of the high affinity component of [3H]PAC binding to alpha 2 receptors. This effect occurred exclusively in the medial hypothalamus (which includes the PVN), without any change in the affinity (Kd) of these receptors. A smaller decline was seen in the low affinity binding sites of the medial hypothalamus, whereas no changes were observed in the density or affinity of the high and low affinity alpha 2 receptor sites in the lateral hypothalamus or frontal cortex. The alpha 1-noradrenergic receptor sites, as defined by [3H]prazosin and [3H]WB-4101 binding, were also unaffected in the different brain areas by 48 hr food deprivation. An additional analysis of alpha 2 receptors in discrete hypothalamic nuclei demonstrated that the deprivation-induced decline in alpha 2-receptor binding: occurred specifically in the PVN; was apparent after as little as 3 hr food deprivation; and occurred only when this brief deprivation fell at the onset of the dark cycle, as opposed to at the end of the dark cycle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Impact of food deprivation on alpha 1- and alpha 2-noradrenergic receptors in the paraventricular nucleus and other hypothalamic areas.","Brain research bulletin","Jhanwar-Uniyal M and Leibowitz SF","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc),no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-27 20:57:22,-1,2021-03-12 00:51:45,,,,,,,,

Cyclic restriction-refeeding increased BERs' tolerance of shock for palatable food.

Also, the need to achieve a minimal body size or body fat content has been postulated to be of importance for determining the timing of the onset of puberty. To evaluate the importance of GH secretion on the onset of sexual maturation in the female rat, GH deprivation has been induced by treating prepubertal rats with antirat GRF serum to passively immunize these animals against GRF. Chronic administration of anti-GRF serum produced in all series an impressive reduction in growth rate (from 5 to 2 g/day), resulting in a body weight averaging 50-60% the normal value at 50 days of life. Despite this deficit in growth, sexual maturation, as established by vaginal opening and first estrous cycles, occurred at the normal age in three of four series of rats; in one series, however, sexual maturation was delayed by 4 days, but thereafter, all parameters indicated that the gonadotropic axis was normally activated. In one series, fertility was tested at 59 days of age in females with a body weight corresponding to 51% of the control weight; these females conceived and delivered a reduced number of pups (9.4 +/- 0.7 instead of 14.2 +/- 0.8 in control dams), but the pups were of normal size. In a second experimental approach, the effect of GH deprivation was evaluated in a model of late sexual maturation obtained by severe food restriction followed by a switch to ad libitum feeding. Severe food restriction initiated at approximately 28 days, when the body weight was 75 g, drastically reduced the growth rate and completely prevented sexual maturation. A switch to ad libitum feeding at 50 days provoked an important compensatory growth and the occurrence of sexual maturation 4 days later. Passive immunization against GRF during this recovery phase did reduce the growth rate, but did not delay sexual maturation. Plasma insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) secretion was very low in food-restricted rats and in each situation with induced GH deprivation. During food restriction, plasma IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) and to a lesser extent IGFBP-1 were decreased, and IGFBP-2 was increased; after switching to ad libitum feeding, plasma levels of IGFBP-2 normalized, but levels of IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3 remained low in the face of normalized plasma IGF-I levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","Growth hormone (GH) deprivation induced by passive immunization against rat GH-releasing factor does not disturb the course of sexual maturation and fertility in the female rat.","Endocrinology","Gruaz NM and Arsenijevic Y and Wehrenberg WB and Sizonenko PC and Aubert ML","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-02-27 21:12:40,-1,2021-03-12 01:02:06,,,,,,,,

Both humans and animals exhibit binge-like intake of highly-palatable food, suggesting that the behavior is driven by the rewarding properties of food, rather than homeostatic signals. Food reward is regulated, in part, by endogenous opioid mechanisms which, themselves, may be altered by excessive eating. We examined this hypothesis by testing whether binge-like sucrose intake modifies the subsequent development of a conditioned place preference (CPP) to sucrose and morphine in both female and male adult rats. Separate groups were given intermittent (12h) or continuous (24h) access to a sweet solution (10% sucrose or 0.1% saccharin) and food in their home cage over 28days. Intermittent sucrose access induced binge-like intake, defined as increased consumption within the first hour; importantly, daily sucrose intake was similar for continuous and intermittent access groups. In a later test, all rats developed a conditioned place preference (CPP) to 15% sucrose with the exception of female and male rats given 12-h intermittent access to sucrose. In a separate experiment, all groups displayed a CPP to morphine (4mg/kg). These findings demonstrate that binge-like sucrose intake, not just increased consumption, disrupts reward processing without affecting stimulus-reward learning.

The D2J allele on chromosome 6 was associated with greater PF intake on training days and greater compulsive-like PF intake, but only in males, suggesting that decreased bitter taste may increase BE in males. The D2J allele on chromosome 11 was associated with an increase in final PF intake and slope of escalation across days.

In the present study, we aimed to determine whether ghrelin is able to influence and/or may even have a role in binge-like eating behaviour in rodents. Accordingly, we used a palatable scheduled feeding (PSF) paradigm in which ad lib. chow-fed rodents are trained to 'binge' on a high-fat diet (HFD) offered each day for a limited period of 2 hours. After 2 weeks of habituation to this paradigm, on the test day and immediately prior to the 2-hour PSF, rats were administered ghrelin or vehicle solution by the i.c.v. route. Remarkably and unexpectedly, during the palatable scheduled feed, when rats normally only binge on the HFD, those injected with i.c.v. ghrelin started to eat more chow and chow intake remained above baseline for the rest of the 24-hour day. We identify the ventral tegmental area (VTA) (a key brain area involved in food reward) as a substrate involved because these effects could be reproduced, in part, by intra-VTA delivery of ghrelin. Fasting, which increases endogenous ghrelin, immediately prior to a palatable schedule feed also increased chow intake during/after the schedule feed but, in contrast to ghrelin injection, did not reduce HFD intake. Chronic continuous central ghrelin infusion over several weeks enhanced binge-like behaviour in palatable schedule fed rats. Over a 4-week period, GHS-R1A-KO mice were able to adapt and maintain large meals of HFD in a manner similar to wild-type mice, suggesting that ghrelin signalling may not have a critical role in the acquisition or maintenance in this kind of feeding behaviour. In conclusion, ghrelin appears to act as a modulating factor for binge-like eating behaviour by shifting food preference towards a more nutritious choice (from HFD to chow), with these effects being somewhat divergent from fasting.","Acute ghrelin changes food preference from a high-fat diet to chow during binge-like eating in rodents.","Journal of neuroendocrinology","Bake T and Hellgren KT and Dickson SL","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-20 20:17:06,-1,2021-02-25 16:04:12,,,,,,,,

The present study abolished the rhythmicity of eating by temporally and quantitatively restricting food access to 12 equally sized bihourly meals daily (total food available was equal to 80% of daily ad libitum intake). Water access remained ad libitum and was monitored and quantified in terms of 1) nocturnality, 2) association with meals, and 3) changes in the association of food and water intake across the phases of the light-dark cycle. Similar parameters were obtained from the same rats with ad libitum access to both food and water. The results indicate that both rhythmic and meal-induced effects are detectable in the drinking of rats with restricted food access, although both the rhythmic and meal-associated factors are reduced compared with drinking under ad libitum food access.

In a recent study, we used the CR schedule with European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) to investigate the effects of an early-life manipulation on adult feeding behaviour. As this was the first time the CR schedule had been used with any bird species, a more in-depth evaluation is warranted. Here, we performed a fuller CR experiment with the same birds as the prior study, a year later. First, we examine the individual consistency of feeding behaviour between experimental sessions and also between CR schedules comprising different ratio requirement progressions. We found that between-session consistency was poor to moderate, and that a geometric ratio progression provided greater between-session consistency than an arithmetic ratio progression. Second, we tried to replicate some of the canonical findings from rats working on CR schedules. In contrast to findings from rats, we found that defence of feeding rates did not increase when starlings were acutely food deprived. However, as in rats, we found that the post-reinforcement pause increased linearly with the upcoming ratio requirement, suggesting that starlings were able to learn the cyclic nature of the schedule. Third, we compared the results from the present study concerning the impacts of our early-life treatment with those from our earlier study. We found that the majority of our previous findings were replicated in the same individuals one year on, reinforcing our previous conclusion that the early-life manipulation had canalised our birds into two groups with different patterns of feeding rate defence.","Evaluating the cyclic ratio schedule as an assay of feeding behaviour in the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris).","PloS one","Dunn J and Andrews C and Nettle D and Bateson M","study with other mammals other than rat mice,study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 21:20:30,-1,2021-02-25 16:04:59,,,,,,,,

Experiment 1 paired a distinct context with footshocks, to examine food intake in food-deprived rats upon re-exposure to the context. Experiment 2 used a discrimination protocol with two alternating contexts; rats were given food in one, and received footshocks in the other. This protocol allowed us to monitor food consumption during training in a context never associated with footshocks, and to evaluate consumption at test in a context that had been previously paired with footshocks. Experiments 1 and 2 compared experimental groups to controls that never received footshocks. Experiment 3 used a within-subjects design to assess the specificity of the inhibition by the contextual cues, separate from any generalized effects due solely to the prior experience of footshocks.

The circadian rhythms are synchronized with the environmental light-dark cycle via signaling from the central circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, and by food intake. The aim of the study was to determine the extent to which disturbance in the SCN signaling via prolonged exposure to constant light affects circadian rhythms in the liver, duodenum, and colon, as well as to determine whether and to what extent food intake can restore rhythmicity in individual parts of the GIT. Adult male rats were maintained in constant light (LL) for 30 days and fed ad libitum throughout the entire interval or exposed to a restricted feeding (RF) regime for the last 14 days in LL. Locomotor and feeding behaviors were recorded throughout the experiment. On the 30th day, daily expression profiles of clock genes (Per1, Per2, Rev-erbalpha, and Bmal1) and of clock-controlled genes (Wee1 and Dbp) were measured by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the duodenum, colon, and liver. By the end of the LL exposure, rats fed ad libitum had completely lost their circadian rhythms in activity and food intake. Daily expression profiles of clock genes and clock-controlled genes in the GIT were impaired to an extent depending on the tissue and gene studied, but not completely abolished. In the liver and colon, exposure to LL abolished circadian rhythms in expression of Per1, Per2, Bmal1, and Wee1, whereas it impaired, but preserved, rhythms in expression of Rev-erbalpha and Dbp. In the duodenum, all but Wee1 expression rhythms were preserved. Restricted feeding restored the rhythms to a degree that varied with the tissue and gene studied. Whereas in the liver and duodenum the profiles of all clock genes and clock-controlled genes became rhythmic, in the colon only Per1, Bmal1, and Rev-erbalpha-but not Per2, Wee1, and Dbp-were expressed rhythmically. The data demonstrate a greater persistence of the rhythmicity of the circadian clocks in the duodenum compared with that in the liver and colon under conditions when signaling from the SCN is disrupted.

The CR regimen (60% of the normal AL consumption) was fed to mice during the daytime (5 hr after lights on). CR animals exhibited fewer feeding episodes but consumed more food per feeding bout and spent more total time feeding than AL mice. It appears that CR caused mice to change from their normal 'nibbling behavior' to meal feeding. Compared to AL animals, the mean body temperature was reduced in CR animals, while the amplitude of the body temperature rhythm was increased. Spans of reduced activity, metabolism, and body temperature (torpor) occurred in CR mice for several hours immediately before feeding, during times of high fatty acid metabolism (low RQ). The acute availability of exogenous substrates (energy supplies) seemed to modulate metabolism shifting metabolic pathways to promote energy efficiency. CR was also associated with lower DNA damage, higher DNA repair, and decreased proto-oncogene expression. Most of the circadian rhythms studied seemed to be synchronized primarily to the feeding rather than the photoperiod cycle.

Whether a predisposition for OCD manifests as binge eating disorder earlier during adolescence is proposed. OBJECTIVES: To further characterize how OCD-like behaviors increase across maturation and to determine whether an OCD-like predisposition increases the likelihood of binge eating during adolescence. METHODS: Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine (CMI, 15 mg/kg) or saline vehicle twice daily between postnatal days 9-15. Both groups were tested for perseverative (spontaneous alternation) and anxiety-like (elevated plus maze; marble burying) behaviors during juvenility (day 28), adolescence (day 60), and adulthood (day 90). Both motivations to eat sucrose pellets and binge eating on fat were investigated. RESULTS: Sex- and age-dependent increases in anxiety-like and perseverative behavior were observed in CMI subjects. Differences in consummatory behaviors emerged during late adolescence, while no significant differences in alternation or anxiety-like behaviors were detected between CMI and vehicle animals until adulthood. Adolescent CMI females consumed more sucrose pellets in 30 min relative to vehicle females, whereas adolescent CMI males consumed approximately half as much as vehicle males. Sucrose consumption did not differ between groups in adulthood. Adolescent CMI rats demonstrated more fat bingeing than vehicles, independent of sex. CONCLUSIONS: OCD-like behaviors are emerging during adolescence, but sucrose consumption and fat bingeing in CMI-treated animals significantly precedes the appearance of anxiety and perseveration. This OCD-like phenotype emerges fully during adulthood, suggesting that eating may likely serve as a coping strategy in these animals.","Developmental emergence of an obsessive-compulsive phenotype and binge behavior in rats.","Psychopharmacology","Freund N and Thompson BS and Norman KJ and Einhorn P and Andersen SL","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 18:59:50,-1,2021-02-25 16:07:16,,,,,,,,

During food restriction, hungry animals are very motivated to obtain food. This motivational state could be a key component in altering the SCN timing by feeding. In order to comprehend how hedonic signals of food affect the SCN clock, we evaluated the effects of a daily palatable snack on the behavioural rhythm of mice fed ad libitum with regular food, and housed under constant darkness conditions. As light synchronization of the SCN is modulated by feeding/metabolic cues, the effects of a palatable meal coupled to a light pulse were tested on behavioural and molecular rhythms. A daily palatable snack entrained behavioural rhythms of mice in constant darkness conditions. Furthermore, palatable meal access at the activity onset reduced light-induced behavioural phase-delays and Period genes expression in the SCN. In addition, an increase in the dopamine content and Period genes expression in the forebrain of mice was observed, concomitant with a c-FOS activation in dopaminergic and orexinergic neurons, suggesting that the effects of a palatable snack on the SCN clock are mediated by the reward/arousal central systems. In conclusion, this study establishes an underlying sensitivity of the master circadian clock to changes in motivational states related to palatable food intake.","Food-reward signalling in the suprachiasmatic clock.","Journal of neurochemistry","Mendoza J and Clesse D and Pevet P and Challet E","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc)",-1,,-1,2021-02-24 19:10:50,-1,2021-02-27 15:19:42,,,,,,,,

A final experiment showed that naloxone can completely abolish the thirst produced by injection of a hypertonic saline solution. This experiment also demonstrated that naloxone could suppress feeding, even though food intake was markedly inhibited by the osmotic thirst stimulus. Hence, the activation of feeding responses (e.g. by food deprivation) is not a necessary condition for naloxone to suppress feeding.

When no food was presented to naive subjects (n = 4), cyclic oscillations of insulinemia were found (period, 12-20 min; amplitude, 2.8-10.3 microU/ml). It is proposed that these spontaneous oscillations must be taken into consideration when evaluating the insulin response on cephalic contact with food stimuli; they might otherwise constitute a source of artifacts. Four subjects were then submitted to a series of four test meals scheduled at a 1-wk interval. Although their prandial glycemia remained comparable with preprandial values for the first 16 min of the meals, insulinemia often exhibited early peaks (within a few min after meal onset) whose amplitude appeared related to palatability conditions.

The sNAcc projects to the lateral hypothalamus (LH), and this pathway has been suggested to modulate palatability-driven feeding behavior. In this study, we investigated the effects of sNAcc mu opioid receptor (MOR) stimulation on firing rates of LH neurons in previously sated rats. Neural firing in the LH was recorded while food-deprived rats performed an operant task to obtain sweetened Intralipid (a 4% fat emulsion containing 5% sucrose) before and after bilateral sNAcc infusion of either a MOR agonist [D-Ala2, N-MePhe4, Gly-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) or a saline control solution. During sessions in which saline was infused into the sNAcc, the number of trials completed after infusion were significantly lower than the number completed before infusion, likely reflecting animals' increased satiety state. During sessions in which DAMGO was infused into the sNAcc, the decrease in the number of trials completed (comparing post- vs. pre-infusion trials) was significantly attenuated. Electrophysiological recording showed that the percentage of LH neurons showing an excitatory response due to behavioral events (cue presentation, lever press, lever retraction, and consumption) was reduced in post vs. pre-saline infusion period. However, the percentage of LH neurons showing excitatory responses to the same behavioral events was similar in pre- and post-DAMGO infusion periods. These findings suggest that MOR stimulation in sNAcc leads to an increase in stimulus-evoked excitatory signaling in LH neurons which could contribute to preventing satiety-induced decline in palatable food intake.","Mu opioid receptor signaling in the nucleus accumbens shell increases responsiveness of satiety-modulated lateral hypothalamus neurons.","The European journal of neuroscience","Tandon S and Keefe KA and Taha SA","",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 19:19:14,-1,2021-02-25 16:07:37,,,,,,,,

In addition, daily rhythms in the expression of circadian clock genes, such as rhythms in Period1 (PER1) or Period2 (PER2), are also shifted in many brain areas that are important for the regulation of motivation and emotion. In order to differentiate brain areas that respond to the time of food presentation from areas that are sensitive to the degree of restriction, the present study compared RF schedules that provided rats with either a 2 h-meal (2hRF) or a 6 h-meal (6hRF) each day. As expected, 2hRF was associated with less food-consumption, more weight-loss, and more food-anticipatory running-wheel activity than 6hRF. In association with these metabolic and behavioral differences, the daily pattern of PER1 and PER2 expression in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH), which has been proposed to be integral to the generation and/or maintenance of food-anticipatory activities, peaked earlier in the 2hRF group and later in the 6hRF group. Because both RF groups exhibited approximately synchronous food-anticipatory activity, but phase shifted rhythms of PER1 and PER2 expression in the DMH, it suggests that the phase of food-anticipatory activity is not directly regulated by this brain area. Next, daily rhythms of PER2 expression in the limbic forebrain responded to each RF schedule in a nucleus-specific manner. In some brain areas, the amplitude of the PER2 rhythm was differentially adjusted in response to 2hRF and 6hRF, while other areas, responded similarly to both RF schedules.

Female mice, with no previous experience with either adult male chemical stimuli or with sucrose, received injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (or vehicle) in the medial shell of the accumbens. Then, we analyzed their preference for male soiled-bedding and their preferential intake of a sucrose solution, with particular emphasis on the dynamics of acquisition of both natural rewards. The results indicate that both lesioned and sham animals showed similar preference for male sexual pheromones, which was constant along the test (linear dynamics). In contrast, lesioned animals differed from sham operated mice in the dynamics of sucrose consumption in their first test of sucrose preference. Sham animals showed an initial sucrose preference followed by preference for water, which can be interpreted as sucrose neophobia. Lesioned animals showed no preference at the beginning of the test, and a delayed sucrose preference appeared followed by a delayed neophobia. The next day, during a second sucrose-preference test, both groups displayed comparable and sustained preferential sucrose intake.

We used female rats as an animal model similar to other models of BE. A novel aspect of this model in this paper is the use of a delayed internal aversive effect produced by lactose ingestion. Establishing this model will allow us to better understand the nature of the conflict between immediate reward and its delayed aversive implications. We hypothesized that BE prone (BEP) rats will demonstrate maladaptive decision making, presenting higher motivation toward PF even when this is associated with delayed discomfort. Method: (Phase 1) 52 female adult Wistar rats were divided to two eating profiles: resistant and prone binge eaters (BER/BEP) based on intake of liquid PF (Ensure). Next, all subjects underwent a Lactose Conditioning Protocol (LCP) that included 4 h tests, one baseline and 3 conditioning days (Phase 2), in which solid PF (Oreo cookies) was paired with glucose (control-no internal aversive effect) or lactose, dissolved in liquid PF. Index for PF motivation was PF consumption during the 4 h LCP. To test for memory of lactose conditioning, we performed another LCP with glucose only (anticipation, but no actual lactose-induced discomfort), a week after the last conditioning session. Results: Lactose conditioned BEP showed higher motivation toward PF compared to lactose conditioned BER faced with delayed aversive effects. Only lactose conditioned BER rats devaluated the PF over LCP days, indicating an association between PF and abdominal discomfort. In addition, only lactose conditioned BER presented an adaptive dynamic behavior, by varying PF intake according to consequences. Furthermore, solid PF consumption was predicted by binge size of liquid PF, only for lactose conditioned rats. Conclusions: We established an animal model for a common eating conflict in humans using delayed internal aversive unconditional stimuli.","A Potential Animal Model of Maladaptive Palatable Food Consumption Followed by Delayed Discomfort.","Frontiers in neuroscience","Moshe L and Bekker L and Weller A","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,2021-03-17 17:34:08,1,2021-02-18 19:17:41,-1,2021-02-18 00:48:07,,,,,,,,

Patients with AD exhibit 'sundown syndrome' featuring mood swings and anxiety. Although there are studies demonstrating circadian rhythm disruption associated with sundown phenomenon, the mechanisms underlying the emotional disturbances remain elusive. In the present study, we examined the relationship between subiculum (a key hippocampal output structure) and anxiety. Our study demonstrates that bilateral ventral subicular lesion (VSL) leads to anxiogenic behavior. In the elevated plus maze test, VSL rats made less number of entries into the open arms and spent significantly more time in the closed arms. Similarly, in the light-dark exploration test, VSL rats spent significantly more time in the dark chamber and made fewer entries into the light chamber. VSL also produced significant neurodegeneration in the paraventricular, suprachiasmatic and dorsomedial nuclei of the hypothalamus. Exposing VSL rats to a short photoperiod regime (SPR; 06/18h light-dark cycle) for 21days ameliorated the anxiety-like behavior. VSL rats on SPR also exhibited increased food consumption and higher core body temperature. Our study supports the hypothesis that the ventral subiculum regulates anxiety-like behavior and that SPR helps in the alleviation of such behavior. Even though the mechanisms underlying anxiolytic effects of light-dark cycle manipulation are yet to be elucidated, such non-pharmacological strategies can help to mitigate anxiety-like behavior. A proper understanding of the effectiveness of photoperiod manipulation will help in developing strategies in the management of emotional disturbances associated with affective and neurodegenerative disorders including AD.","Exposure to short photoperiod regime reduces ventral subicular lesion-induced anxiety-like behavior in Wistar rats.","Physiology & behavior","Subhadeep D and Srikumar BN and Shankaranarayana Rao BS and Kutty BM","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 23:19:44,-1,2021-02-25 16:08:43,,,,,,,,

A prodromal stage characterized by psychiatric disturbances normally precedes primary motor symptoms and suppressed motivation represents one of the earliest and most common psychiatric symptoms. Although dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) critically regulates motivation and altered dopamine signaling is implicated in HD, the nature of dopaminergic deficits and contribution to symptoms in HD is poorly understood. We therefore tested whether altered NAc dopamine release accompanies motivational deficits in the Q175 knock-in HD mouse model. Q175 mice express a CAG expansion of the human mutant huntingtin allele in the native mouse genome and gradually manifest symptoms late in life, closely mimicking the genotypic context and disease progression in human HD. Sub-second extracellular dopamine release dynamics were monitored using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, whereas motivation was assessed using a progressive ratio reinforcement schedule. As the response ratio (lever presses per reward) escalated, Q175 mice exerted less effort to earn fewer rewards versus wild-type (WT). Moreover, dopamine released at reward delivery dynamically encoded increasing reward cost in WT but not Q175 mice. Deficits were specific to situations of high effortful demand as no difference was observed in locomotion, free feeding, hedonic processing, or reward seeking when the response requirement was low. This compromised dopaminergic encoding of reward delivery coincident with suppressed motivation to work for reward in Q175 mice provides novel, neurobiological insight into an established and clinically relevant endophenotype of prodromal HD. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Psychiatric impairments in Huntington's disease (HD) typically manifest early in disease progression, before motor deficits. However, the neurobiological factors contributing to psychiatric symptoms are poorly understood. We used a mouse HD model and assessed whether impaired dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region critical to goal-directed behaviors, accompanies motivational deficits, one of the most common early HD symptoms. HD mice exhibited blunted motivation to work for food reward coincident with diminished dopamine release to reward receipt. Motivational and NAc dopaminergic deficits were not associated with gross motor deficits or impaired food seeking when effortful demands were low. This work identifies a specific prodromal HD phenotype associated with a prominent and previously unidentified neurobiological impairment.","Compromised Dopaminergic Encoding of Reward Accompanying Suppressed Willingness to Overcome High Effort Costs Is a Prominent Prodromal Characteristic of the Q175 Mouse Model of Huntington's Disease.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Covey DP and Dantrassy HM and Zlebnik NE and Gildish I and Cheer JF","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 22:56:02,-1,2021-02-25 17:50:45,,,,,,,,

Despite progress in elucidating neural and molecular mechanisms of circadian oscillators, localization of food-entrainable oscillators driving FAA remains an enduring problem. Recent evidence suggests that the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH) may function as a final common output for behavioral rhythms and may be critical for the expression of FAA (Gooley JJ, Schomer A, and Saper CB. Nat Neurosci 9: 398-407, 2006). To determine whether the reported loss of FAA by DMH lesions is specific to one behavioral measure or generalizes to other measures, rats received large radiofrequency lesions aimed at the DMH and were recorded in cages with movement sensors. Total and partial DMH ablation was associated with a significant attenuation of light-dark-entrained activity rhythms during ad libitum food access, because of a selective reduction in nocturnal activity. When food was restricted to a single 3-h daily meal in the middle of the lights-on period, all DMH and intact rats exhibited significant FAA. The rhythm of FAA persisted during a 48-h food deprivation test and reappeared during a 72-h deprivation test after ad libitum food access. The DMH is not the site of oscillators or entrainment pathways necessary for all manifestations of FAA, but may participate on the output side of this circadian function.","Persistence of a behavioral food-anticipatory circadian rhythm following dorsomedial hypothalamic ablation in rats.","American journal of physiology.

At estrus and at proestrus, preparations from restricted diet rats exhibited greater initial (post-isolation) IDT and better contractile constancy during 60 min than did uteri from normal fed rats. This enhanced contractile constancy, but not that of preparations from control fed rats, was prevented by incubation 'in vitro' with indomethacin (10(-6) M). At metestrus and at diestrus, uteri from normal fed rats presented higher initial levels of IDT and even more sustained contractile constancy than at estrus or at proestrus. Moreover, contractile profiles remained unaltered following the dietary restriction and the presence of indomethacin evoked similar negative inotropic actions in both experimental groups (fed and underfed). Dose-response curves for methoxamine documented its positive, but different, inotropic actions in the two groups and at the four periods of the estrous cycle. Indeed, in the underfed group at estrus and at proestrus, dose-response curves for methoxamine were shifted to the left of those in fed controls, a situation prevented by indomethacin (10(-6) M); whereas at metestrus and at diestrus, no differences in the inotropic reactivity towards methoxamine between the two experimental groups, were detected. On the other hand, indomethacin shifted to the right dose-response curves for the agonist, both in preparations from normal fed and from restricted diet rats. The generation and release of PGF2 alpha and of PGE2 were explored under normal and restricted diet conditions, both at estrus and at diestrus. Following the dietary restriction, the output of PGE2 from estrous uteri was augmented in comparison to controls, whilst the release of PGF2 alpha was not affected. At diestrus, dietary restriction failed to alter the uterine output of either one of these PGs. Results suggest that a greater generation and release of PGE2, following underfeeding, appears to subserve the increased spontaneous motility and the greater sensitivity of the rat uterus for adrenoreceptor agonists.","Prostaglandin output from and the spontaneous inotropism of uterine horns isolated from underfed rats at different stages of the sex cycle.

Such antagonism of histamine receptors abolished drinking elicited by exogenous histamine without affecting drinking after water deprivation. Histaminergic antagonism did not affect spontaneous eating, but it appeared to abolish drinking prior to a meal (for only those 3 rats which exhibited such drinking), delayed the latency to initiate drinking after initiating a meal, and inhibited drinking which occurred during and after eating but prior to postprandial resting (i.e., satiety for food). Because antagonism of peripheral histamine receptors inhibited food-related drinking by over 60%, these results provide indirect support for the hypothesis that the preabsorptive food-contingent vagally-mediated release of gastric mucosal histamine plays a major role in spontaneous food-related drinking in the rat.","Histamine plays a major role for drinking elicited by spontaneous eating in rats.","Physiology & behavior","Kraly FS and Specht SM","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 22:55:28,-1,2021-02-25 17:56:49,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have also pointed out a previously underestimated association between ADHD and abnormal eating behaviors, including binge eating. Since sleep/alertness disturbances and eating disorders may significantly increase the functional impairment of ADHD, gaining insight into their pathophysiology as well as into their treatment is of relevance to provide a better clinical management of patients suffering from ADHD. The hypocretin/orexin system comprises two distinct peptides, located in the hypothalamus, which are involved in several homeostatic functions. In particular, it has been suggested that hypocretin/orexin neurons located in perifornical and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei increase arousal, whereas those located in the lateral hypothalamus are primarily implicated in reward processing, stimulating feeding and other reward seeking behaviors. Given the involvement of the hypocretin/orexin system in the control of alertness and reward seeking (including feeding), we hypothesize that hypocretin/orexin neurons located in perifornical and dorsomedial hypothalamic areas are hypoactivated, while those located in the lateral hypothalamus are overactivated in patients with ADHD. If confirmed by further neurophysiological, imaging, and genetics studies, our hypothesis may help us progress in the understanding of the complex pathophysiology of ADHD. This might set the basis for the study of novel molecules, acting on the hypocretin/orexin system, aimed at increasing wakefulness and reducing binge eating and other abnormal reward seeking behaviors in patients with ADHD. We also suggest future studies on the potential therapeutic role of other molecules which have a complex interplay with the hypocretin/orexin system, such as the histamine H(1) receptor agonists, the histamine H(3) receptor antagonists, and the neuropeptide Y receptor antagonists. All this body of research would provide a tremendous opportunity to improve the quality of life of patients with ADHD by means of pathophysiologically oriented treatment.","Alertness and feeding behaviors in ADHD: does the hypocretin/orexin system play a role?","Medical hypotheses","Cortese S and Konofal E and Lecendreux M","non-experimental study,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 14:40:30,-1,2021-02-25 17:57:04,,,,,,,,

Women are more prone to obesity and binge eating than men, which warrants comparisons of hedonic versus physiological consumption and the underlying neural substrates in both sexes. The current study examined palatable (high-sugar) food consumption in male and female rats under physiological hunger and satiety, and the role of the neuropeptide orexin/hypocretin (ORX). Across multiple tests, females consistently consumed similar amounts of palatable food regardless of whether they were hungry or sated prior to testing. In contrast, males typically adjusted their consumption according to their hunger/satiety state. This difference was specific to palatable food consumption, as both sexes ate standard chow according to their hunger state. ORX is important in food motivation and reward behaviors. Thus, to begin to determine the neuronal mechanisms of hedonic eating, we examined activation and signaling of ORX neurons. We systematically characterized Fos induction patterns of ORX neurons across the entire rostrocaudal extent of the lateral hypothalamus and found that they were activated by food and by fasting in both sexes. Then, we showed that systemic blockade of ORX receptor 1 signaling with SB-334867 decreased palatable food consumption in hungry and sated rats of both sexes.

The activity of 34 hypoglossal (mXII) neurons was characterized during the ingestion and rejection of gustatory stimuli in the awake rat. Intraoral infusions of water, sucrose, sodium chloride, or hydrochloric acid initiated ingestion responses; infusions of quinine monohydrochloride initiated rejection responses. Electromyographic (EMG) activity from three oropharyngeal muscles monitored the occurrence of lick cycles and swallows (ingestion) and gape cycles (rejection). In addition, the orofacial region was videotaped to provide an independent assessment of lingual and jaw movements in relation to neural activity. 2. EMG activity during lick and gape cycles was quantified by calculating the duration, magnitude, and peak time of muscle contractions. Lick and gape cycles produced highly differentiated patterns of activity from jaw-opener (anterior digastric, AD), lingual protrudor (geniohyoid, GEN), and lingual retractor (styloglossus, STY) muscles. Lick cycles were characterized by an alternating two-phase sequence of protrusion-retraction; gape cycles by an initial coactivation of both lingual muscles (phase I), followed by a sequence of protrusion (phase II) and retraction (phase III). Contraction durations were significantly longer during gape cycles compared with lick cycles for the AD (Xlick +/- 59 ms; Xgape +/- 134 ms, means +/- SD), GEN (Xlick +/- 77 ms; Xgape +/- 200 ms), and STY (Xlick +/- 93 ms; Xgape +/- 220 ms) muscles. 3. Thirty-one out of 34 mXII neurons were functionally classified as protrudor- or retractor-related by cross-correlating anterior digastric EMG activity with neural activity during licking. Fourteen out of 34 neurons were protrudor-related, 17/34 were retractor-related. These classifications were largely consistent with the results from an analysis of a subset of cells (n = 14) that directly compared neural activity with videotaped records of visible tongue movements. 4. The magnitude of mXII activity during ingestion and rejection was compared by determining the mean number of spikes per lick, gape, and swallow for each neuron. Five out of 14 (36%) protrudor-related and 10/17 (59%) retractor-related cells had significant increases in activity during gape responses compared with the number of spikes per lick cycle. This increased activity of mXII neurons was consistent with the more robust lingual motor activity during the gape response. Two protrudor-related and three retractor-related neurons showed significant decreases in activity during gape responses. Although a similar proportion of mXII neurons exhibited decreases in activity during swallows compared with licks (3 protrudor- and 1 retractor-related), fewer mXII neurons (1 protrudor- and 1 retractor-related) showed increased activity during swallows.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","Hypoglossal neural activity during ingestion and rejection in the awake rat.","Journal of neurophysiology","Dinardo LA and Travers JB","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc),no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-27 22:01:35,-1,2021-03-12 20:41:12,,,,,,,,

Usually, cues are 'wanted' only if their rewards have ever been 'liked,' but here we show that mesocorticolimbic systems can recompute 'wanting' de novo by integrating novel physiological signals with a cue's preexisting associations to an outcome that lacked hedonic value. That is, a cue's incentive salience can be recomputed adaptively. We demonstrate that this recomputation is encoded in neural signals coursing through the ventral pallidum. Ventral pallidum neurons do not ordinarily fire vigorously to a cue that predicts the previously 'disliked' taste of intense salt, although they do fire to a cue that predicts the taste of previously 'liked' sucrose. Yet we show that neural firing rises dramatically to the salt cue immediately and selectively when that cue is encountered in a never-before-experienced state of physiological salt depletion. Crucially, robust neural firing to the salt cue occurred the first time it was encountered in the new depletion state (in cue-only extinction trials), even before its associated intense saltiness has ever been tasted as positively 'liked' (salt taste had always been 'disliked' before). The amplification of incentive salience did not require additional learning about the cue or the newly positive salt taste. Thus dynamic recomputation of cue-triggered 'wanting' signals can occur in real time at the moment of cue re-encounter by combining previously learned Pavlovian associations with novel physiological information about a current state of specific appetite.","Dynamic computation of incentive salience: 'wanting' what was never 'liked'.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Tindell AJ and Smith KS and Berridge KC and Aldridge JW","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-27 21:42:32,-1,2021-03-12 20:34:06,,,,,,,,

In the previous work, maintenance food was withheld for shorter and longer durations on different days following access to the training food. Extra eating before the longer fast was interpreted as avoidance of hunger. This interpretation was based on the evidence showing that extra eating as a result of classical conditioning comes from pairing food stimuli with the presence of little or no hunger because of repletion with energy nutrients. The theory that the extra eating arose from a response-depletion contingency was tested in the present experiment by training rats on only a long fast or only a short fast. Greater increase in intake was seen before the longer fast. The results also replicated previously seen cycles of increase, decrease, and renewed increase in putative deficit-avoidant eating over about three trials, indicating that the extra eating reduces the response-reinforcing hunger and that the consequent part-extinction restores reinforcement. The shape of the learning curve was consistent with these cycles occurring from the start of training, further supporting the view that the increase in food intake before a long delay in refeeding is hunger-reinforced instrumental behaviour.","Rats learn to eat more to avoid hunger.","Quarterly journal of experimental psychology (2006)","Jarvandi S and Thibault L and Booth DA","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,2021-03-17 17:43:36,1,2021-02-15 15:34:06,-1,2021-01-29 22:18:07,,,,,,,,

Moreover, whether circadian rhythms of particular motivated behaviors exist is unknown. Here, we evaluated the spontaneous daily and circadian behavior of consumption of a sweet caloric solution (5-10% sucrose), and the effects of sucrose intake on the expression of clock genes in the mouse brain. Mice showed a daily (in a light-dark cycle) and a circadian (in constant darkness conditions) rhythm in the intake and sucrose preference with a rise for both parameters at night (or subjective night).

Stimulation of enzyme secretion by hourly injection of the pancreozymin congener, caerulein, led to more increased phosphatidylinositol synthesis than with a single injection of pilocarpine. The amylase level of the pancreas remained at a low level as long as caerulein was injected, indicating continued stimulation of enzyme secretion even though increased phosphatidylinositol synthesis ceased after 6 h. Feeding gave the same stimulation of phosphatidylinositol synthesis as caerulein. The major synthesis of phosphatidylinositol in controls and the stimulation of phosphatidylinositol synthesis by pilocarpine was entirely confined to the microsome fraction throughout the experiments (up to 18 h). This shows that there is no flow of microsomal membrane (smooth- or rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum) to other membranous structures throughout the secretory cycle and beyond. It is concluded that the stimulation of phosphatidylinositol synthesis by pancreatic secretagogues is confined to microsomal elements and does not play any role in membrane flow.","The effects of secretagogues on the incorporation of (2- 3 H)myoinositol into lipid in cytological fractions in the pancreas of the guinea pig in vivo.","The Journal of cell biology","Gerber D and Davies M and Hokin LE","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc),no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-27 21:44:39,-1,2021-03-12 20:34:29,,,,,,,,

A timed caloric restriction in rats fed at dawn induces phase-advances and further phase-stabilization of these rhythms, suggesting that the circadian clock can integrate conflicting daily photic and non-photic cues. The present study investigated the daily expression of Fos-like immunoreactivity (Fos-ir) and light pulse-induced Fos-ir in the SCN, the intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) and the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) in calorie-restricted rats fed 2 h after the onset of light and in controls fed ad libitum. A daily rhythm of Fos-ir in the SCN was confirmed in control rats, with a peak approximately 2 h after lights on. At this time point (i.e. just prior to the feeding time), the level of SCN Fos-ir was lowered in calorie-restricted rats. Concomitantly, IGL Fos-ir was higher in calorie-restricted vs. control rats. In response to a light pulse during darkness, Fos-ir induction was found to be specifically (i.e. phase-dependently) lowered in the SCN and IGL of calorie-restricted rats. Observed changes of Fos-ir in the PVT were possibly related to the wake state of the animals.

It has become increasingly apparent that there is a significant overlap between the systems regulating drug reward and food intake, therefore, we investigated whether 18-MC might modulate the effects of ghrelin, one of several orexigenic peptides recently implicated in both feeding and drug reward. OBJECTIVES: In female Sprague-Dawley rats, we determined whether acute 18-MC treatment would reduce both ghrelin-induced increases in sucrose intake and ghrelin-elicited increases in accumbal dopamine levels. RESULTS: Pretreatment with 18-MC (20 mg/kg, i.p.), given prior to the administration of ghrelin (1 mug, lateral ventricle), blocked ghrelin-induced increases in sucrose (5%) intake in a two-bottle open access paradigm. Using in vivo microdialysis, 18-MC (both 20 and 40 mg/kg) prevented ghrelin (2 mug, intraventral tegmental area)-induced increases in extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. 18-MC had no effect on deposition of fat or on serum levels of glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol in ghrelin-treated rats. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that one potential mechanism by which 18-MC exerts its effects on palatable food consumption is via modulation of ghrelin's effects.","Effects of 18-methoxycoronaridine on ghrelin-induced increases in sucrose intake and accumbal dopamine overflow in female rats.","Psychopharmacology","McCallum SE and Taraschenko OD and Hathaway ER and Vincent MY and Glick SD","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 19:41:22,-1,2021-02-25 17:57:38,,,,,,,,

In both experiments, patterns of licking were analyzed in adult female Sprague-Dawley rats during an 0.8 M sucrose test meal. In Experiment 1, meal microstructure was determined preOVX and 10-12 days postOVX. Rate of licking following OVX was not changed during min 1 of the meal, but was significantly faster during min 2-4 of the meal (p < 0.03). The numbers of bursts (runs of licks separated by 250-500 ms) and numbers of clusters (runs of licks separated by > 500 ms) were significantly increased during min 2-4 (p < 0.05).

Binge eating on palatable food (PF) is a core, maladaptive symptom that cuts across all major types of eating disorders and can be studied via animal models. Using an individual differences rat model of binge eating that identifies binge eating prone (BEP) and binge eating resistant (BER) phenotypes, we previously showed that, compared with males, females consume more PF and are more likely to be classified as BEP. One potential explanation for this sex difference is that PF is inherently more rewarding to females, leading to higher rates of binge eating. Here we tested the hypothesis that females have more robust behavioral and neural responses to PF reward than males. Adult male (N=18) and female (N=17) Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to the Conditioned Place Preference paradigm using PF as the unconditioned stimulus. Select males (N=9) and females (N=9) were video-recorded during three of the PF-paired conditioning sessions to score feeding behavior. Following CPP, 13 male and 12 female rats were exposed to PF just prior to sacrifice to induce expression of the neural activation marker Fos, and Fos expression was quantified in mesocorticolimbic, hypothalamic, and amygdalar circuits. In the CPP paradigm, females displayed a more robust shift in preference for the chamber paired with PF compared with males, and behavioral analyses revealed that average duration of individual feeding bouts during pairing sessions was longer in females than in males. Fos expression was significantly higher in females vs. males in select regions of the mesocorticolimbic reward circuit, with no sex differences in hypothalamic or amygdalar regions. These results provide initial evidence that PF may be more rewarding to females than to males, possibly due to heightened responsiveness of neural substrates that mediate the hedonic and motivational responses to PF, which in part, may underlie sex differences in binge eating proneness.","Preliminary evidence of sex differences in behavioral and neural responses to palatable food reward in rats.","Physiology & behavior","Sinclair EB and Hildebrandt BA and Culbert KM and Klump KL and Sisk CL","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 19:28:30,-1,2021-02-25 17:58:42,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have shown that ghrelin potently increases growth hormone release and food intake. The aim of this study was to clarify the physiological implications of ghrelin in the regulation of energy balance, by assessing the effect of undernutrition throughout 21 days in normal-cycling and pregnant rats on ghrelin. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: We have determined ghrelin levels by radioimmunoassay and gastric ghrelin mRNA expression by Northern blot analysis during 21 days of chronic food restriction (30% of ad libitum available diet) in normal-cycling female rats and in pregnancy. RESULTS: Our results show that chronic food restriction led to an increase in plasmatic ghrelin levels in normal-cycling female rats. In pregnancy, ghrelin plasmatic levels were enhanced particularly during the latter part of gestation (19 and 21 days) compared with pregnant rats with free access to food. Gastric ghrelin mRNA expression showed a similar expression pattern, being higher in the food-restricted group than in the group fed ad libitum, in normal-cycling as well as in pregnant rats. DISCUSSION: These observations indicate that ghrelin plasmatic levels and ghrelin gastric mRNA are up-modulated during undernutrition in normal-cycling rats and in pregnancy. These findings suggest that increased ghrelin levels may have a role in mediating the physiological responses to undernutrition and could represent an adaptative response to prevent long-lasting alterations in energy balance and body weight homeostasis.","Effect of food restriction on ghrelin in normal-cycling female rats and in pregnancy.","Obesity research","Gualillo O and Caminos JE and Nogueiras R and Seoane LM and Arvat E and Ghigo E and Casanueva FF and Dieguez C","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 21:25:14,-1,2021-02-25 17:59:58,,,,,,,,

These effects are mainly driven through the release of hormones from the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA).

This study aims to evaluate the effect of chronic restraint stress, applied for 30 days, and estrogen replacement on behavior, glucose level, and the lipid profile of ovariectomized rats. Our results suggest that stress increases sweet food consumption in OVX females treated with estradiol (E2), but reduces consumption in animals not treated. Furthermore, stress increases locomotor activity and anxiety as assessed by the Open Field test and in the Elevated Plus Maze. Similarly, our results suggest that E2 increases anxiety in female rats under the same behavioral tests. In addition, stress reduces glucose and TC levels. Moreover, stress increase TG levels in the presence of E2 and decrease in its absence, as well as the estradiol increase TG levels in stressed groups and reduced in non-stressed groups.

These studies were prompted by prior work indicating that food deprivation increased the number of immunocytochemically identified cells containing estradiol receptors in the medial preoptic area of ovariectomized female hamsters. Presumably, this is one way that changes in metabolic fuel availability might alter the responsiveness of one or more systems to estradiol. The purpose of this study was to investigate two effects of estradiol that might be affected by food deprivation; these were 1) the positive feedback effects of estradiol on the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, and 2) the facilitating effects of estradiol on locomotor activity. In Experiment 1, ovariectomized hamsters were administered estradiol, before or after 48 h of food deprivation. Two days after hormone treatment, blood was obtained by cardiac puncture, once in the morning (1100 h) and twice during the afternoon (1600-1800 h). These times were chosen to best characterize the magnitude of the LH surge. Food deprivation enhanced the amplitude of the LH surge in response to estradiol when this treatment preceded, but not when it followed, the administration of estradiol. However, there was variability in the dose of estradiol at which this effect of food deprivation occurred. In Experiment 2, the locomotor (running wheel) activity of two groups of gonadally intact female hamsters was quantified; one group was tested during the early (days 1 + 2; low estradiol) part of the estrous cycle, and the other group was tested during the late (days 3 + 4; high estradiol part of the estrous cycle. In both groups, testing was performed first under ad lib feeding conditions and again during 48 h of food deprivation. On average, the days 3 + 4 group was more active than the days 1 + 2 group, reflecting their differing levels of endogenous estradiol. Food deprivation significantly increased locomotor activity, independently of the stage of the estrous cycle during which it was imposed. These results are discussed in terms of the influence that altered estradiol receptor expression in the medial preoptic area might play in generating the effects we observed following short-term food deprivation.","Food deprivation and the facilitatory effects of estrogen in female hamsters: the LH surge and locomotor activity.","Physiology & behavior","Mangels RA and Jetton AE and Powers JB and Wade GN","study with other mammals other than rat mice,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-27 20:54:01,-1,2021-03-11 03:53:05,,,,,,,,

In rats, giving intermittent access to sweet fat food mimics this aspect of binge eating. These models typically employ solid food; however, the total amount consumed depends on motivation, palatability and satiety, which are difficult to dissociate with solid food. In contrast, lick microstructure analysis can be used to dissociate these parameters when the ingestant is a liquid. Therefore, we developed a binge model using a liquid emulsion composed of corn oil, heavy cream and sugar. We show that rats given intermittent access to this high-fat emulsion develop binge-like behavior comparable to that previously observed with solid high-fat food. One feature of this behavior was a gradual escalation in consumption across 2.5 weeks of intermittent access, which was not apparent in rats given lower-fat liquid on the same access schedule. Lick microstructure analysis suggests that this escalation was due at least in part to increases in both motivation to consume and palatability-driven consumption.","Intermittent access to sweet high-fat liquid induces increased palatability and motivation to consume in a rat model of binge consumption.","Physiology & behavior","Lardeux S and Kim JJ and Nicola SM","",1,,1,2021-02-20 20:16:05,1,2021-02-25 18:01:12,,,,,,,,

As part of a detailed study of hyperactivity and anorexia, spontaneous wheel running by male rats was studied under three conditions: ad libitum feeding; restriction to 15 g of food per day; and restriction to a single 90-min meal per day. Ad libitum fed rats increased their running at the rate of 440 +/- 60 m/day per day, stabilizing after day 10 at 6045 +/- 3010 m/day. The running occurred in short bursts throughout the dark period and at the beginning of the light period. Rats restricted to 15 g/day increased their running at the significantly greater (p < 0.001) rate of 1230 +/- 120 m/day per day, reaching 12 200 +/- 4 090 m/day by day 10 and thereafter stabilizing at 13 600 +/- 4 160 m/day. The running was initially triphasic and confined to the dark period but eventually progressed to a biphasic pattern. The rats restricted to a single 90-min access period to food each day showed an even greater rate of increase in running, attaining 1930 +/- 288 m/day per day (p < 0.02 vs. 15 g/day group). These animals decreased eating and decompensated by day 4. The diurnal pattern of activity was disturbed from day 1 of the protocol, and by day 4 the rats ran essentially continuously throughout the daily cycle. The sensitivity to hyperactivity is a function of the severity of food restriction in this animal model of hyperactivity. It is paralleled by a marked disturbance of the diurnal pattern of activity, suggesting that the hyperactivity is related to a basic central nervous system dysfunction.","Diurnal variation of intensive running in food-deprived rats.","Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology","Morse AD and Russell JC and Hunt TW and Wood GO and Epling WF and Pierce WD","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc)",-1,,-1,2021-02-24 19:06:30,-1,2021-02-27 15:31:55,,,,,,,,

The goal of this study was to determine the impact of the relatively enriched environment recommended by current animal care guidelines on development and maintenance of binge-type behavior in rats, using the limited access (LA) binge model. Non-food-deprived rats were divided into two groups, enriched and nonenriched, with all rats housed in shoebox cages. Bedding, nesting material, toys, and a solid floor were provided only to the enriched group to create a state of relative enrichment, or RE, compared to the nonenriched conditions historically used in the LA model. Enriched and nonenriched groups were further divided into control and experimental groups. Control rats received access to an optional source of fat (vegetable shortening) for 30min each day (daily access) while experimental rats received 30-min optional fat access on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday only (intermittent access). The four groups were designated C-E (Control-Enriched), C-NE (Control-Nonenriched), I-E (Intermittent-Enriched), and I-NE (Intermittent-Nonenriched). Bingeing in the LA model is established when a group with intermittent access (i.e., the I-E or I-NE group) consumes significantly more vegetable shortening during the limited access period than a group with daily access (i.e., the C-E or C-NE group). Access sessions continued for 8weeks under these conditions, at which time the housing conditions of the I-E and I-NE groups were reversed for an additional 8weeks of access sessions. Intakes of the C-E and C-NE groups were similar and data from these two groups were combined. Relative to this Combined Control Group (CCG), the I-NE group began bingeing in week 3 while the I-E group binged during weeks 6 and 8. Following the reversal at the beginning of week 9, the newly enriched I-NE group ceased bingeing in week 9 but resumed bingeing in weeks 10-16. The newly nonenriched I-E group continued bingeing through the remainder of the study. Intakes of the I-E and I-NE groups were not significantly different at any time during the study. These results indicate that RE delays binge onset; that is, RE increases the time between the first fat access session and the first occurrence of bingeing. However, RE does not significantly alter the amount of fat consumed during binge sessions. Furthermore, addition of RE to a nonenriched group of animals (I-NE) does not reverse established binge behavior. Thus it appears that regardless of enrichment condition, intermittent access to vegetable shortening induces greater consumption of fat than does daily access. However, it is clear that a certain level of austerity in housing conditions is required for rapid development of lasting binge-type eating to occur. In addition, results suggest that it is unlikely that enrichment, to the degree provided in this study, can prevent or reverse binge-type eating in rats.","Relatively enriched housing conditions delay binge onset but do not attenuate binge size.","Physiology & behavior","Preston KE and Corwin RL and Bader JO and Crimmins SL","",1,,1,2021-02-20 20:09:10,1,2021-02-25 18:02:13,,,,,,,,

A lickometer recorded the timing of each lick, from which the microstructural parameters of bout frequency and bout duration were also computed. All compounds reduced the mean bout duration, while 7-OH-DPAT and raclopride also brought about a compensatory increase in bout number. Analysis of the licking rates over the test session showed that 7-OH-DPAT, quinpirole and raclopride decreased the initial rate, without affecting the rate of decline of licking. Changes in licking microstructure (i.e. initial rate of licking and mean bout duration) after the administration of 7-OH-DPAT, quinpirole and raclopride, are consistent with an action of these dopaminergic compounds to reduce palatability.","The effects of 7-OH-DPAT, quinpirole and raclopride on licking for sucrose solutions in the non-deprived rat.","Behavioural pharmacology","Genn RF and Higgs S and Cooper SJ","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 19:24:05,-1,2021-02-25 18:02:47,,,,,,,,

Three groups (n = 6) received peripheral injections of methylphenidate in doses of 1.5 or 0.75 mg/kg/day, or saline, 3 days prior and 7 days during a previously characterized intermittent feeding regimen that results in a gradual increase of sucrose and food intake. The higher, but not the lower, dose of methylphenidate reduced sucrose intake to an asymptotic level starting after 3 days of the feeding protocol and concurrently led to an increase in the intake of chow. The high dose methylphenidate group also had two-fold lower plasma insulin levels compared with the saline-treated animals at the time of sacrifice on the last day of the feeding regimen. Further histological assays revealed that the methylphenidate treatments, irrespective of the dose used, resulted in selectively higher dopamine transporter and D2-like receptor labeled bindings in the shell region of the nucleus accumbens. These results suggest that relatively low-dose methylphenidate treatments may be effective for the management of binge eating by reducing the intake of palatable foods and may not interfere with short-term regulation of energy balance.

Although VR performance showed greater resistance to small reductions in the concentration of the sucrose reinforcer than VI performance, VR performance was more sensitive to large reductions in the sucrose concentration. Despite this differential sensitivity only the smallest dose of pimozide (0.125 mg/kg) differentially affected these behaviors by reducing VI rates without affecting VR rates. These and other results support the view that low doses of pimozide reduce the hedonic impact of the reinforcer. The results also indicate that the attenuation of operant responding by higher doses (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg) cannot be solely a result of the blunting of reward. Experiment 2 demonstrated that when rats drink in daily, brief one-bottle tests they show greater resistance to reductions in the sucrose concentration than when they lever-press for sucrose, and require a higher dose of pimozide (2.0 mg/kg) to attenuate consumption.

While homeostatic intake peaks in the active phase, conditioned place preference and choice experiments show an increased sensitivity to overeating on palatable food during the rest phase. This hedonic appetite rhythm is driven by endogenous circadian clocks in dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA).

27630701,31780908,31780908,"","In female rodents, sexual receptivity is coordinated with cyclic changes in the release of gonadal hormones. Increases in estradiol (E) and progesterone (P) during proestrus and estrus not only induce ovulation but also modulate behaviors that increase the likelihood that the female will find a mate and reproduce. This includes changes in receptive behaviors, such as lordosis, as well as changes in appetitive or proceptive behaviors, including motivation. Interestingly, the direction of these changes in motivation is dependent on the type of reward that is being pursued. While induction of sexual receptivity by E and P increases motivation for access to a male, motivation for a palatable food reward is decreased. These concurrent changes may facilitate adaptive choice across the estrous cycle; females bias their choice for sex when fertilization is most likely to occur, but for food when copulation is unlikely to result in impregnation. In order to test this hypothesis, we developed a novel paradigm to measure the motivated choice between a palatable food reward and access to a male conspecific. Ovariectomized, hormone primed females were trained to operantly respond for both food and sex on a fixed interval (FI) schedule. After training, unprimed and primed females were tested in a chamber that allows them to choose between food and sex while still requiring responding on the FI schedule for reach reward. From this we can not only determine the impact of hormone priming on female choice for food or sex, but also how this is reflected by changes in motivation for each specific reward, as measured by the average number of responses made during each fixed interval. Induction of sexual receptivity by hormone priming biases choice toward sex over food and this change is accompanied by an increase in motivation for sex but a decrease in motivation for food. This work provides evidence in support of a novel framework for understanding how the release of ovarian hormones over the course of the estrous cycle modulates adaptive behavioral choice in females by directly assessing motivation via operant responding when multiple rewards are available.","Ovarian Hormones Mediate Changes in Adaptive Choice and Motivation in Female Rats.","Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience","Yoest KE and Cummings JA and Becker JB","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-24 18:54:49,-1,2021-02-27 15:41:40,,,,,,,,

Stress or perceived stress is an often-cited reason for binge eating.

Using young adult female rats in a dietary-induced binge eating model (30 min access to binge food with or without 24-h calorie restriction, twice a week, for 6 weeks) we measured the neural activation by c-Fos immunoreactivity to the binge food (vegetable shortening mixed with 10% sucrose) in bingeing and non-bingeing animals under acute stress (immobilization; 1 h) or no stress conditions. There was an increase in the number of immunopositive cells in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in stressed animals previously exposed to the binge eating feeding schedules. Because attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) medications target the mPFC and have some efficacy at reducing binge eating in clinical populations, we examined whether chronic (2 weeks; via IP osmotic mini-pumps) treatment with a selective alpha-2A adrenergic agonist (0.5 mg/kg/day), guanfacine, would reduce binge-like eating. In the binge group with only scheduled access to binge food (30 min; twice a week; 8 weeks), guanfacine increased total calories consumed during the 30-min access period from the 2-week pre-treatment baseline and increased binge food consumption compared with saline-treated animals. These experiments suggest that mPFC is differentially activated in response to an immobilization stress in animals under different dietary conditions and chronic guanfacine, at the dose tested, was ineffective at reducing binge-like eating.","Dietary-induced binge eating increases prefrontal cortex neural activation to restraint stress and increases binge food consumption following chronic guanfacine.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior","Bello NT and Walters AL and Verpeut JL and Caverly J","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc),no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 18:59:32,-1,2021-02-25 18:10:03,,,,,,,,

Caffeine is also a minor psychostimulant that seems to act as an appetite suppressant, but there are also reports indicating that it could stimulate appetite. Dopamine also is involved in food motivation and in behavioral activation. In the present series of experiments, we evaluated the effects of acute administration of caffeine on food consumption under different access conditions. CD1 male adult mice had access to highly palatable food (50% sucrose) in a restricted but habitual context, under continuous or intermittent access as well as under anxiogenic, or effortful conditions. Caffeine (2.5-20.0 mg/kg) increased intake at the highest dose under familiar continuous and intermittent access. However, this high dose reduced food intake in the dark-light paradigm. In contrast, a dopamine-depleting agent, tetrabenazine (TBZ; 1.0-8.0 mg/kg) did not affect food intake in any of those experimental conditions. In the T-maze-barrier task that evaluates seeking and taking of food under effortful conditions, caffeine (10.0 mg/kg) decreased latency to reach the food, but did not affect selection of the high-food density arm that required more effort, or the total amount of food consumed. In contrast, TBZ (4.0 mg/kg) reduced selection of the high food density arm with the barrier, thus affecting amount of food consumed. Interestingly, a small dose of caffeine (5.0 mg/kg) was able to reverse the anergia-inducing effects produced by TBZ in the T-maze. These results suggest that caffeine can potentiate or suppress food consumption depending on the context. Moreover, caffeine did not change appetite, and did not impair orientation toward food under effortful conditions, but it rather helped to achieve the goal by improving speed and by reversing performance to normal levels when fatigue was induced by dopamine depletion.","Caffeine Modulates Food Intake Depending on the Context That Gives Access to Food: Comparison With Dopamine Depletion.","Frontiers in psychiatry","Correa M and SanMiguel N and Lopez-Cruz L and Carratala-Ros C and Olivares-Garcia R and Salamone JD","",1,2021-03-17 17:44:14,1,2021-02-24 19:02:20,-1,2021-02-27 15:41:40,,,,,,,,

Of interest, rats with previous restricted access to SCM responded similarly under the devalued and nondevalued conditions, indicating loss of goal-directed control of responding. To identify whether the loss of goal-directed control was accompanied by differences in neuronal activity, we used c-Fos immunohistochemistry to examine the patterns of activation during devaluation testing. We observed greater c-Fos immunoreactivity in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) and associated cortical regions in the group that received previous restricted access to SCM and demonstrated a lack of sensitivity to outcome devaluation. Infusion of the AMPA-receptor antagonist CNQX or dopamine D1-receptor antagonist SCH-23390 into the DLS before testing restored goal-directed performance in the restricted SCM group, confirming that this region is essential for habit-based performance. These results indicate that previous diet can alter subsequent learning and activity in the neural circuits that support performance.","Binge-like consumption of a palatable food accelerates habitual control of behavior and is dependent on activation of the dorsolateral striatum.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Furlong TM and Jayaweera HK and Balleine BW and Corbit LH","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,2021-03-17 17:46:12,1,2021-02-22 19:08:27,-1,2021-02-25 18:11:08,,,,,,,,

The impact of SR on performance in rodents is often assessed using tasks in which food is the reward. Investigating how the drives of hunger and sleep interact to modulate performance may provide insights into mechanisms underlying sleep loss-related performance decrements. METHODS: Three experiments were conducted in male adult Wistar rats to assess: (1) effects of food restriction on performance in the simple response latency task (SRLT) across the diurnal cycle (n = 30); (2) interaction of food restriction and SR (11 h) on SRLT performance, sleep electroencephalogram, and event-related potentials (ERP) (n = 10-13); and (3) effects of food restriction and SR on progressive ratio (PR) task performance to probe the reward value of food reinforcement (n = 19). RESULTS: Food restriction increased premature responding on the SRLT at the end of the light period of the diurnal cycle. SR led to marked impairments in SRLT performance in the ad libitum-fed group, which were absent in the food-restricted group. After SR, food-restricted rats displayed a higher amplitude of cue-evoked ERP components during the SRLT compared with the ad libitum group. SR did not affect PR performance, while food restriction improved performance. CONCLUSIONS: Hunger may induce a functional resilience to negative effects of sleep loss during subsequent task performance, possibly by maintaining attention to food-related cues.","Food restriction induces functional resilience to sleep restriction in rats.","Sleep","Loomis S and McCarthy A and Dijk DJ and Gilmour G and Winsky-Sommerer R","",-1,2021-03-17 17:46:48,1,2021-02-24 18:44:55,-1,2021-02-27 15:46:28,,,,,,,,

Stimulation of angiotensin type 2 (AT2) receptor is reported to inhibit dopamine synthesis. We investigated the possible roles of AT2 receptor-mediated dopamine regulation in the pathogenesis of BED. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice, type 2 diabetic (KKAy) mice and AT2 receptor-null (AT2KO) mice at eight weeks old were treated with AT2 receptor agonist, compound 21 (C21) or saline for two weeks. Mice were subjected to fasting for two days followed by re-feeding for seven days. RESULTS: Treatment with C21 attenuated the rebound proportion of body weight, food intake and water intake in KKAy mice, but not in C57BL/6 and AT2KO mice. Dopamine concentration in the striatum was further increased by fasting in KKAy and AT2KO mice. Administration of C21 significantly attenuated this fasting-induced increase in dopamine level only in KKAy mice. Dopamine receptor D1, D2 expression in the substantia nigra were markedly lower in KKAy mice compared with C57BL/6 mice, while administration of C21 increased their expression in KKAy mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that AT2 receptor stimulation may be a new therapeutic approach to improve eating disorder associated with dopamine resistance.","Angiotensin II type 2 receptor signaling affects dopamine levels in the brain and prevents binge eating disorder.","Journal of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system : JRAAS","Nakaoka H and Mogi M and Kan-No H and Tsukuda K and Ohshima K and Wang XL and Chisaka T and Bai HY and Shan BS and Kukida M and Iwanami J and Horiuchi M","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 22:52:27,-1,2021-02-25 18:13:24,,,,,,,,

To determine whether this sensitivity extended into oocyte development, we examined the effect of maternal normal protein diet (18% casein; NPD) or isocaloric low protein diet (9% casein; LPD) restricted to one ovulatory cycle (3.5 days) prior to natural mating in female MF-1 mice. After mating, all females received NPD for the remainder of gestation and all offspring were litter size adjusted and fed standard chow. No difference in gestation length, litter size, sex ratio or postnatal growth was observed between treatments. Maternal LPD did, however, induce abnormal anxiety-related behaviour in open field activities in male and female offspring (P < 0.05). Maternal LPD offspring also exhibited elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) in males at 9 and 15 weeks and in both sexes at 21 weeks (P < 0.05). Male LPD offspring hypertension was accompanied by attenuated arterial responsiveness in vitro to vasodilators acetylcholine and isoprenaline (P < 0.05). LPD female offspring adult kidneys were also smaller, but had increased nephron numbers (P < 0.05). Moreover, the relationship between SBP and kidney or heart size or nephron number was altered by diet treatment (P < 0.05). These data demonstrate the sensitivity of mouse maturing oocytes in vivo to maternal protein undernutrition and identify both behavioural and cardiovascular postnatal outcomes, indicative of adult disease. These outcomes probably derive from a direct effect of protein restriction, although indirect stress mechanisms may also be contributory. Similar and distinct postnatal outcomes were observed here compared with maternal LPD treatment during post-fertilization preimplantation development which may reflect the relative contribution of the paternal genome.","Low protein diet fed exclusively during mouse oocyte maturation leads to behavioural and cardiovascular abnormalities in offspring.","The Journal of physiology","Watkins AJ and Wilkins A and Cunningham C and Perry VH and Seet MJ and Osmond C and Eckert JJ and Torrens C and Cagampang FR and Cleal J and Gray WP and Hanson MA and Fleming TP","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-26 14:55:00,-1,2021-02-27 15:46:59,,,,,,,,

The higher food intake in obese rats is mainly caused by larger meals since obese rats ate fewer meals than lean rats. Only for the obese group differences were observed between mean meal size in light and dark phase. There is some indication that the circadian controlled temporal distribution of meals is different in obese rats compared to lean rats since obese rats eat fewer but larger meals during the first half of the dark phase.

PYY-treated rats chose to sustain shock to retrieve and consume the preferred food, at a significantly greater speed and quantity. The number of approaches that were met without retrieval of food due to anxiety after PYY treatment indicates that PYY increased motivation towards feeding, rather than anxiolysis.

However, neural and behavioral measures are noisy, requiring averaging over trials and subjects. Unfortunately, averaging can obscure the very dynamics that we are interested in, masking abrupt changes and artificially creating gradual processes. We develop a hidden semi-Markov model for precisely characterizing dynamic processes and their alteration due to experimental manipulations. This method takes advantage of multiple trials and subjects without compromising the information available in individual events within a trial. We apply our model to studying the effects of motivation on response rates, analyzing data from hungry and sated rats trained to press a lever to obtain food rewards on a free-operant schedule. Our method can accurately account for punctate changes in the rate of responding and for sequential dependencies between responses. It is ideal for inferring the statistics of underlying response rates and the probability of switching from one response rate to another. Using the model, we show that hungry rats have more distinct behavioral states that are characterized by high rates of responding and they spend more time in these high-press-rate states. Moreover, hungry rats spend less time in, and have fewer distinct states that are characterized by a lack of responding (Waiting/Eating states).

Rats fed ad libitum, in constant darkness, received a palatable meal for 6 weeks starting in the middle of the subjective day. Locomotor activity showed entrainment when the offset of activity coincided with the palatable meal-time. In the SCN, the peak expression of c-Fos was observed at palatable meal-time and PER-1 showed a peak during the onset of subjective night, as predicted according to the behavioural entrained pattern. In addition, c-Fos and PER-1 expression in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) showed increased expression at palatable meal-time, while the intergeniculate leaflet did not, suggesting that the PVT may be involved as an input pathway of palatable food-entrainment to the SCN.

Thus it is interesting that Syrian hamsters fail to increase food intake after a period of food deprivation, despite a fall in plasma leptin concentrations similar to those seen in food-deprived rats and mice. In previous laboratory studies, food-deprived Syrian hamsters increased the amount of food hoarded. We hypothesized that leptin treatment during food deprivation would attenuate food-deprivation-induced increases in hoarding. Baseline levels of hoarding were bimodally distributed, with no hamsters showing intermediate levels of hoarding. Both high (HH) and low hoarding (LH) hamsters were included in each experimental group. Fifty-six male hamsters were either food deprived or given ad libitum access to food for 48 h. One-half of each group received intraperitoneal injections of leptin (4 mg/kg) or vehicle every 12 h during the food-deprivation period. Within the HH group, the hoarding score increased significantly in food-deprived but not fed hamsters (P < 0.05). Leptin treatment significantly decreased hoarding in the food-deprived HH hamsters (P < 0.05). The LH hamsters did not increase hoarding regardless of whether they were food deprived or had ad libitum access to food. These results are consistent with the idea that HH hamsters respond to energetic challenges at least in part by changing their hoarding behavior and that leptin might be one factor that mediates this response.","Food hoarding is increased by food deprivation and decreased by leptin treatment in Syrian hamsters.","American journal of physiology.

When compared with F344 rats, LOU rats showed lower corticosterone (Cort) levels across the circadian cycle and after restraint stress. Then, we compared the effects of adrenalectomized (ADX) and Cort substitution after ADX on food intake, body weight gain, body composition, and biochemical parameters related to metabolism and HPA axis function between 1) the F344 rat strain, a model of HPA axis hyperactivity and hyperreactivity to stress, and characterized by a large fat mass; 2) the LOU strain, shown to exhibit hypoactive/hyporeactive HPA axis, reduced fat mass, and resistance to diet-induced obesity; and 3) the Lewis (LEW) strain, a third condition of fat deposition (high) related to HPA axis function (low activity/reactivity). The F344 and LEW strains exhibited classical responses to ADX and Cort. On the contrary, LOU rats showed an apparent insensitivity to ADX. Despite the highest effects of Cort related to glucocorticoid receptor (on thymus weight, corticotropin-releasing factor, or corticosteroid-binding globulin), the LOU strain was insensitive to Cort effects on body weight, liver, and abdominal fat mass. These characteristics could be involved in the leanness, insensitivity to diet-induced obesity, and healthy aging in LOU.

Increasingly, children are exposed to a junk-food diet during gestation and early development. Excessive consumption of junk-food during this period may negatively impact the development of brain motivation and reward pathways. In this study we investigated the effects of a chronic junk-food diet throughout development on cue-motivated behavior ('wanting'), hedonic 'liking' for sweet tastes, as well as anxiety and weight gain in male and female Long-Evans (LE) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Here we found that chronic exposure to a junk-food diet resulted in large individual differences in weight gain (gainers and non-gainers) despite resulting in stunted growth as compared to chow-fed controls. Behaviorally, junk-food exposure attenuated conditioned approach (autoshaping) in females, particularly in non-gainers. In contrast, junk-food exposed rats that gained the most weight were willing to work harder for access to a food cue (conditioned reinforcement), and were more attracted to a junk-food context (conditioned place preference) than non-gainers. Hedonic 'liking' reactions (taste reactivity) were severely blunted in LE, but not SD rats, and 'liking' for sucrose negatively correlated with greater weight gain. Finally, junk-food exposure reduced anxiety-like behavior (elevated plus maze) in males but not females. These results suggest that junk-food exposure during development may give rise to dissociable differences in 'liking' and 'wanting' neural systems that do not depend on weight gain and may not be detected through Body Mass Index monitoring alone.","The impact of a junk-food diet during development on 'wanting' and 'liking'.","Behavioural brain research","Lesser EN and Arroyo-Ramirez A and Mi SJ and Robinson MJ","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,2021-03-17 17:47:41,0,2021-02-22 19:15:18,-1,2021-02-25 18:14:56,,,,,,,,

Lack of water or food inhibited body growth. Short photoperiod (LD 8:16) enhanced body growth in males fed 'poor diet' but it had no effect in animals on 'high quality diet'. Cold exposure diminished body growth in animals with access to water but not in those deprived of water. It is suggested that lowered motor activity is mainly responsible for body mass gain of animals kept under the short photoperiod. All stressful factors (water deprivation, 'poor diet' or cold) induced involution of testes. The time course of testicular involution was similar to that induced by short photoperiod. Testicular involution was, after several weeks, followed by spontaneous recrudescence. Combination of stressful external cues speeded up testicular involution. Since the testicular involution induced by water deprivation, 'poor diet' and cold also occurred in animals kept in constant light or under long photoperiod (which are known to produce functional pinealectomy) it is concluded that the inhibitory effects of stressful external factors on testes are not mediated by the pineal. The decrease in testosterone production induced by external cues precedes changes in testicular mass. In individuals kept in the cold, testosterone production remains low, in spite of spontaneous recrudescence of the testes. No simple relationship between testosterone concentration in the blood and testicular mass was observed.

Here we enumerate possible mechanisms using a previously published model of optimal foraging by one consumer (microtine rodent) of two types of food plant (1 preferred and 1 non-preferred). Rate constants for each of the model parameters were sought from the extensive literature on vole cycles. For a range of likely values of input parameters, we evaluated model fit by applying five empirically derived criteria for cyclic behaviour. These were: cycles with a period length of 2-5 yr, peak densities of 100-350 voles per ha and trough densities of 0-25 ha(-1), ratio of peak to trough densities of 10-100, and the occurrence of a catastrophic collapse in the vole population followed by a prolonged low phase. In contrast to previous models of food-induced microtine cycles, the optimal foraging model successfully reproduced the first four criteria and the prolonged low phase. The criterion of population collapse was met if the non-preferred food began producing lethal toxins at a threshold grazing intensity, as predicted by PLTP. Fewer criteria could be met in variations on the model, in which the non-preferred food was equally as nutritious as the preferred food or was continuously toxic.","Model of microtine cycles caused by lethal toxins in non-preferred food plants.","Journal of theoretical biology","Kent A and Jensen SP and Doncaster CP","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-02-16 18:03:55,-1,2021-02-18 00:34:36,"Este estudio es en plantas","","","",,,,

However, the impairment of the circadian clock by type 2 diabetes has not been fully elucidated. To understand whether and how the function of circadian clock is impaired under the diabetic condition, we examined not only the expression of circadian genes in the heart and pineal gland but also the behavioral rhythm of type 2 diabetic and control rats in both the nighttime restricted feeding (NRF) and daytime restricted feeding (DRF) conditions. In the NRF condition, the circadian expression of clock genes in the heart and pineal gland was conserved in the diabetic rats, being similar to that in the control rats. DRF shifted the circadian phases of peripheral clock genes more efficiently in the diabetic rats than those in the control rats. Moreover, the activity rhythm of rats in the diabetic group was completely shifted from the dark phase to the light phase after 5 days of DRF treatment, whereas the activity rhythm of rats in the control group was still under the control of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) after the same DRF treatment. Furthermore, the serum glucose rhythm of type 2 diabetic rats was also shifted and controlled by the external feeding schedule, ignoring the SCN rhythm. Therefore, DRF shows stronger effect on the reentrainment of circadian rhythm in the type 2 diabetic rats, suggesting that the circadian system in diabetes is unstable and more easily shifted by feeding stimuli.","Enhanced effect of daytime restricted feeding on the circadian rhythm of streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetic rats.","American journal of physiology.

Key depressive symptoms can be modeled in animals and enable the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Chronic unavoidable stress disrupts rats' competence to escape noxious stimuli and self-administer sucrose, configuring a depression model characterized by escape deficit and motivational anhedonia associated to impaired dopaminergic responses to sucrose in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcS). Repeated treatments that restore these responses also relieve behavioral symptoms. Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons encode reward and motivation and are implicated in the neuropathology of depressive-like behaviors. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors type-alpha (PPARalpha) acutely regulate VTA dopamine neuron firing via beta2 subunit-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (beta2*nAChRs) through phosphorylation and this effect is predictive of antidepressant-like effects. Here, by combining behavioral, electrophysiological and biochemical techniques, we studied the effects of repeated PPARalpha stimulation by fenofibrate on mesolimbic dopamine system. We found decreased beta2*nAChRs phosphorylation levels and a switch from tonic to phasic activity of dopamine cells in the VTA, and increased phosphorylation of dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein Mr 32,000 (DARPP-32) in the NAcS. We then investigated whether long-term fenofibrate administration to stressed rats reinstated the decreased DARPP-32 response to sucrose and whether this effect translated into antidepressant-like properties. Fenofibrate restored dopaminergic responses to appetitive stimuli, reactivity to aversive stimuli and motivation to self-administer sucrose. Overall, this study suggests PPARalpha as new targets for antidepressant therapies endowed with motivational anti-anhedonic properties, further supporting the role of an unbalanced mesolimbic dopamine system in pathophysiology of depressive disorders.","PPARalpha modulation of mesolimbic dopamine transmission rescues depression-related behaviors.","Neuropharmacology","Scheggi S and Melis M and De Felice M and Aroni S and Muntoni AL and Pelliccia T and Gambarana C and De Montis MG and Pistis M","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-27 21:08:46,-1,2021-03-12 00:59:04,,,,,,,,
27630726,6020284,6020284,"Animals,*Behavior, Animal,Environment,Light,*Mice,Reward","Detailed studies of the behavior of captive white-footed mice have cast a number of old problems in new perspectives. Many responses of small captive mammals cannot be interpreted at face value because of severe distortions of behavior that are caused by depriving the wild animal of natural outlets for activity. Confined animals are likely to seize upon and repeatedly exercise virtually any opportunities to modify (and alter their relationships with) their surroundings. In addition they have a strong tendency to counteract nonvolitional and 'unexpected' deviations from the status quo. As a result, their responses do not bear an immutable relationship to the nature of the stimulus or other variable being modified; stimuli and activities that are rewarding in certain circumstances are avoided in others. These aspects of behavior have been illustrated by studies of nest occupancy, running in motordriven wheels, and control of intensity of illumination. The results of the control-of-illumination studies suggest the complex interplay of tendencies to modify features of the environment, to avoid conditions imposed compulsorily, and to select preferred levels of illumination. The importance of split-second timing, coordination, and quick reflex actions in the running of activity wheels is indicated by the fact that experienced white-footed mice prefer running in square 'wheels' and wheels with hurdles to running in plain round wheels. The relatively conservative behavior of these mice in selecting between multiple sources of food and water and different types of activity wheels suggests the need for careful experimental design in free-choice studies with inexperienced animals. The tendency of trained animals to give some so-called 'incorrect' responses even after long experience can be interpreted most reasonably in terms of the adaptive value of a certain degree of variability of behavior in the wild. White-footed mice readily master complex regimes in which several different levers and shutters must be pressed or rotated in certain sequences within seconds for different rewards. They quickly learn to traverse mazes containing hundreds of blind alleys and do so frequently without extrinsic reward. It is unlikely that these remarkable learning performances even begin to approach the capacities of the animals. When two female mice having markedly different solitary behavior patterns were placed in consort, the behavior of each changed, becoming more like that of the other, and the animals showed a strong tendency to remain in each other's company. The behavior of mice in enclosures of great extent casts doubt upon the postulate that hunger and thirst play leading roles in the motivation of wide-ranging locomotor movements. Accordingly, studies of deprived domestic animals in simple mazes may have but limited significance for understanding the behavior of wild and relatively unconfined animals. The existence of marked individual differences between mice selected at random from wild populations sounds the need for a cautious approach in the interpretation of results obtained with highly inbred domestic animals. The relatively uniform behavior of inbred strains represents only a small fragment of the total response spectrum for the species and probably has minimal significance for adaptation and evolution in the wild. When allowed to control the intensity of illumination by operating a series of switches, white-footed mice establish a roughly 24-hour regime consistent with that experienced in the wild, namely dim light during periods of activity and very dim light during periods of inactivity. Consistent with this finding, when exposed to a dim-dark light cycle, the mice are active during the dim phase, not in darkness. Artificial twilight transitions of both constant and varying color temperature have several marked effects upon the activity of white-footed mice. The existence of a strong orienting influence of dim light on the direction of wheel-running suggests that mice in the wild use the twilight sun and the moon (and possibly other celestial light sources) as navigational references.","Behavior of captive white-footed mice.","Science (New York, N.Y.)","Kavanau JL","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-02-24 19:12:06,-1,2021-02-27 15:49:45,,,,,,,,

The latency to initiate drinking was increased and drinking behavior was suppressed in the first hour after injection in a dose-dependent manner. The consummatory indices of drinking were not affected. After this period of adipsia, a phase of polydipsia, that was probably due to the diuretic effect of U50, was evident. This prophagic effect of U50 was evident only at the dose of 3 mg/kg and was accompanied by an increased duration of feeding episodes but not by a reduced latency to feed.

SUMMARY ANSWER: This is the first report of cycle variability in the exploratory and interactive behaviour, and food consumption in menstruating spiny mice, and demonstrates that physiological changes are also dependent on within-subject variation. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a prominent cyclic disorder that affects millions of women worldwide. More than 70% of women endure symptoms of impending menstruation, such as bloating, abdominal cramping and nausea to some degree. Consequently, ~8% of women experience recurrent physical and emotional symptoms which are extreme enough to disrupt daily life and seek intervention. Due to a lack of an appropriate animal model, the mechanisms underlying PMS are poorly understood, and subsequently, effective treatments are limited. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This study analyses the changes in behavioural responses to the investigator during vaginal lavage (n = 14), exploratory behaviour (n = 11) and metabolism (n = 20) across the menstrual cycle in the spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We performed vaginal lavages on virgin spiny mice (6-8 months of age) and subjected each cohort of females to repeated measures for vaginal lavage, exploratory behaviour and metabolism. Stages of the menstrual cycle were designated as early follicular, late follicular, early luteal, late luteal, early menstrual and late menstrual, with the late luteal and early menstrual phases considered as premenstrual phases and analysed using generalized estimating equations. For vaginal lavage, the behavioural responses to researcher handling were scored on an increasing scale of severity during the lavage process (e.g. restraint, frequency of vocalizations, total handling time). For exploratory behaviour, exploration, memory and sociability were assessed through subjection to Open Field (OF), Novel Object Recognition (NORT), Social Novelty (SN) and Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) tests. For metabolism, physiological changes were measured over a 24-h period in metabolic cages. Results are mean +/- SD with statistical significance set to P < 0.05. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Qualitative behavioural assessment showed that compared to early follicular controls, during premenstrual phases, cycling females had significantly increased probability of: manifesting difficulties during restraint (4x, P < 0.01), vocalizing (8x, P < 0.01) and exhibiting isolation in the cage (40x, P = 0.041). We saw significant increases in handling time during the premenstrual phase in cycling females (76 +/- 16 s) compared to controls (55 +/- 7 s, P < 0.001). For exploratory behaviour, cycling females in their early menstrual phase travelled significantly less distance in the outer zone of the OF arena (13.3 +/- 9.0 m) than females in their early luteal phase (22.3 +/- 9.9 m, P = 0.038) and at significantly reduced velocities (40.2 +/- 10.5 mm/s and 78.8 +/- 31.0 mm/s, respectively, P = 0.006). These females also had fewer entries into the EPM open arms during the same phases (9.6 +/- 6.1 and versus 20.0 +/- 7.2, respectively, P = 0.030) and travelled less distance (3.2 +/- 2.8 m versus 7.0 +/- 5.5 m, respectively, P = 0.026). No differences were observed in NORT or SN across the cycle. In the metabolism studies, spiny mice demonstrated a significant increase in food consumption (percentage of body weight) during the early follicular and late luteal phases (3.9 +/- 2.4% and 3.8 +/- 2.1%, respectively) compared to the late follicular phase (2.3 +/- 2.6%, P = 0.015). LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This is an observational study to determine fundamental changes in behaviour and metabolism in a novel species, and as such, lacks commercially available laboratory reagents and protocols specific to the spiny mouse. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The timing of these behavioural and physiological changes suggests that spiny mice exhibit symptoms analogous to PMS in higher order primates, thus providing a pre-clinical model for testing novel interventions to alleviate premenstrual symptoms and overcoming many limitations associated with this research area.

Female hamsters fed ad libitum and given a choice between food and adult male hamsters are highly motivated to visit males instead of food on all four days of the estrous cycle, but after 8days of mild food restriction (75% of ad libitum intake) they shift their preference toward food every day of the estrous cycle until the day of estrus, when they shift their preference back toward the males. In support of a role for RFRP-3 in these behavioral changes, the preference for food and the activation of RFRP-3-immunoreactive (Ir) cells in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) showed the same estrous cycle pattern in food-restricted females, but no association was observed between behavior and the activation of Kp cells in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus or preoptic area. Next, we tested the hypothesis that food-restriction-induced activation of RFRP-3-Ir cells is modulated by high levels of ovarian steroids at the time of estrus. In support of this idea, on nonestrous days, mild food restriction increased activation of RFRP-3-Ir cells, but failed to do so on the day of estrus even though this level of food restriction did not significantly decrease circulating concentrations of estradiol or progesterone. Furthermore, in ovariectomized females, food-restriction-induced increases in activation of RFRP-3-Ir cells were blocked by systemic treatment with progesterone alone, estradiol plus progesterone, but not estradiol alone. Central infusion with RFRP-3 in ad libitum-fed females significantly decreased sexual motivation and produced significant increases in 90-minute food hoarding, in support of the hypothesis that elevated central levels of RFRP-3 are sufficient to create the shift in behavioral motivation in females fed ad libitum. Together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that high levels of ingestive motivation are promoted during the nonfertile phase of the estrous cycle by elevated activation of RFRP-3-Ir cells, and RFRP-3-Ir cellular activation is modulated by ovarian steroids around the time of estrus, thereby diverting attention away from food and increasing sexual motivation.","Food restriction-induced changes in motivation differ with stages of the estrous cycle and are closely linked to RFamide-related peptide-3 but not kisspeptin in Syrian hamsters.","Physiology & behavior","Benton NA and Russo KA and Brozek JM and Andrews RJ and Kim VJ and Kriegsfeld LJ and Schneider JE","study with other mammals other than rat mice,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-27 22:00:01,-1,2021-03-12 20:39:30,,,,,,,,

Sex differences regarding the association of behavioral parameters with serotonergic and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activities were investigated in the chronic mild stress model of depression. Additionally, the impact of chronic mild stress exposure on an additional/novel short-term stressful procedure, such as the forced swim test was examined in male and female rats. Female rats were found to be more vulnerable to chronic mild stress and that was depicted with disruption of sucrose intake, decreases in open field activity, increased corticosterone levels, alteration in estrous cycle and decreased serotonergic activity in hippocampus and hypothalamus. On the contrary, in males the current chronic mild stress protocol elicited only behavioral changes, such as disruption in sucrose intake and decreased open field activity. Interestingly, in response to forced swim test, females previously subjected to chronic mild stress, were found to cope better by exhibiting increased active behavior in the second forced swim test session and higher hypothalamic serotonergic activity in comparison with corresponding males. On the other hand, males were more affected by previous chronic mild stress exposure and that was manifested by decreased active behavior in the first forced swim test session and increased corticosterone levels following second forced swim test session. These data indicate that although females are more vulnerable in the application of chronic mild stress than males, in response to an additional-novel stressor (forced swim test) they show better response.

It was found that the response is not uniform within the D-phase; survivability, food intake, and maintenance of body mass were all favored by access to food during the final six hours vs the initial six hours. Deprivation experience enhanced survivability with the early-food, presumably through a reduction in locomotor activity and not by increased food intake.

For 5 days, female Wistar rats were trained to self-administer standard 45 mg food pellets in one daily session (30 minutes) under FR1 (fixed ratio 1) schedule of reinforcement. Rats were then trained to an FR3 schedule and finally divided into two groups. The first group (control) was subjected to a standard 30 minutes FR3 food self-administration session.

Results: We found that both food-predictive cue and hunger increased conditioned approaches to the receptacle (food-seeking behavior indicated by movement to the food receptacle). In addition, we observed dopamine release when the food-predictive cue (but not the unpaired cue) was presented, independent of hunger or satiety. Finally, we found a positive correlation between dopamine release amplitude and the number of conditioned approaches to the food receptacle in the sated condition, but not in the hungry condition. Discussion: Our results suggest that dopamine could drive seeking behavior for calorie-dense food in absence of homeostatic need, a core aspect of binge eating disorders.","Stimuli predicting high-calorie reward increase dopamine release and drive approach to food in the absence of homeostatic need.","Nutritional neuroscience","Gomez-A A and Shnitko TA and Caref KL and Nicola SM and Robinson DL","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 20:50:04,-1,2021-02-25 18:16:22,,,,,,,,

The 24-hour rhythm in circulating corticosterone of rodents, known since the 1950s, was studied as a presumed proxy for stress on 108 rats divided into 9 groups of 6 male and 9 groups of 6 female animals sampled every 4 hours for 24 hours. In a first stress study, the 'no-rhythm' (zero-amplitude) assumption failed to be rejected at the 5% probability level in the two control groups and in 16 out of the 18 groups considered. A circadian rhythm could be detected with statistical significance, however, in three separate follow-up studies in the same laboratory, each on 168 rats kept on two antiphasic lighting regimens, with 4-hourly sampling for 7 or 14 days. In the first stress study, pooling of certain groups helped the detection and assessment of the circadian corticosterone rhythm. Without extrapolating to hormones other than corticosterone, which may shift more slowly or adjust differently and in response to different synchronizers, the three follow-up studies yielded uncertainty measures (95% confidence intervals) for the point estimate of its circadian period, of possible use in any future study as a reference standard. The happenstance of a magnetic disturbance at the start of two follow-up studies was associated with the detection of a circasemiseptan component, raising the question whether a geomagnetic disturbance could be considered as a 'load'. Far beyond the limitations of sample size, the methodological requirements for standardization in the experimental laboratory concerning designs of studies are considered in the context of models of depression. Lessons from nature's unforeseen geomagnetic contribution and from human studies are noted, all to support the advocacy, in the study of loads, of sampling schedules covering more than 24 hours.","Stress, geomagnetic disturbance, infradian and circadian sampling for circulating corticosterone and models of human depression?","Neurotoxicity research","Olah A and Jozsa R and Csernus V and Sandor J and Muller A and Zeman M and Hoogerwerf W and Cornelissen G and Halberg F","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-26 14:59:04,-1,2021-02-27 15:50:34,,,,,,,,

Poor maternal care and bonding can also impact offspring development and disease risk.We therefore hypothesized that prenatal nutrition would affect maternal care and that an interaction may exist between a maternal HF diet and maternal care, subsequently impacting on offspring phenotype.Wistar rats were mated and randomized to control dams fed a control diet (CON) or dams fed a HF diet from conception until the end of lactation (HF). Maternal care was assessed by observing maternal licking and grooming of pups between postnatal day (P)3 and P8. Postweaning (P22), offspring were fed a control (-con) or HF (-hf) diet. From P27, pubertal onset was assessed. At approximately P105 oestrous cyclicity was investigated. Maternal HF diet reduced maternal care; HF-fed mothers licked and groomed pups less than CON dams.Maternal fat:lean ratio was higher in HF dams at weaning and was associated with higher maternal plasma leptin and insulin concentrations, but there was no effect of maternal care on fat:lean ratio or maternal hormone levels. Both female and male offspring of HF dams were lighter from birth to P11 than offspring of CON dams, but by P19, HF offspring were heavier than controls. Prepubertal retroperitoneal fat mass was greater in pups from HF-fed dams compared to CON and was associated with elevated circulating leptin concentrations in females only, but there was neither an effect of maternal care, nor an interaction between maternal diet and care on prepubertal fat mass. Pups from HF-fed dams went into puberty early and this effect was exacerbated by a postweaning HF diet.Maternal and postweaning HF diets independently altered oestrous cyclicity in females: female offspring of HF-fed mothers were more likely to have prolonged or persistent oestrus, whilst female offspring fed a HF diet postweaning were more likely to have irregular oestrous cycles and were more likely to have prolonged or persistent oestrus. These data indicate that maternal HF nutrition during pregnancy and lactation results in a maternal obese phenotype and has significant impact on maternal care during lactation. Maternal and postweaning nutritional signals, independent of maternal care, alter offspring body fat pre-puberty and female reproductive function in adulthood, which may be associated with advanced ovarian ageing and altered fertility.","Nature, nurture or nutrition?

This 'frustration stress' manipulation also activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress axis. Here, we determined the role of the stress neurohormone corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in stress-induced binge eating in our model. We also assessed the role of CRF receptors in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a brain region implicated in stress responses and stress-induced drug seeking, in stress-induced binge eating. We used four groups that were first exposed or not exposed to repeated intermittent cycles of regular chow food restriction during which they were also given intermittent access to high-caloric palatable food. On the test day, we either exposed or did not expose the rats to the sight of the palatable food for 15 min (frustration stress) before assessing food consumption for 2 h. We found that systemic injections of the CRF1 receptor antagonist R121919 (2,5-dimethyl-3-(6-dimethyl-4-methylpyridin-3-yl)-7 dipropylamino pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine) (10-20 mg/kg) and BNST (25-50 ng/side) or ventricular (1000 ng) injections of the nonselective CRF receptor antagonist D-Phe-CRF(12-41) decreased frustration stress-induced binge eating in rats with a history of food restriction.

They regulate PV neuron function and plasticity to maintain cortical excitatory/inhibitory balance. For example, reductions in PNN intensity are associated with reduced local inhibition and enhanced pyramidal neuron firing. We previously found that exposure to dietary high fat reduced PNN intensity within the PFC of male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. However, how high fat affects PNNs in the PFC of females or in obesity-vulnerable vs. -resistant models is unknown. Therefore, we gave male and female SD, selectively bred obesity-prone (OP), and obesity-resistant rats (OR) free access to standard lab chow or 60% high fat for 21 days. We then measured the number of PNN positive cells and PNN intensity (determined by Wisteria floribunda agglutinin [WFA] staining) as well as the number of PV positive neurons using immunohistochemistry. We found sex and region-specific effects of dietary high fat on PNN intensity, in the absence of robust changes in cell number. Effects were comparable in SD and OP but differed in OR rats. Specifically, high fat reduced PNN intensities in male SD and OP rats but increased PNN intensities in female SD and OP rats. In contrast, effects in ORs were opposite, with males showing increases in PNN intensity and females showing a reduction in intensity. Finally, these effects were also region specific, with diet-induced reductions in PNN intensity found in the prelimbic PFC (PL-PFC) and ventral medial orbital frontal cortex (vmOFC) of SD and OP males in the absence of changes in the infralimbic PFC (IL-PFC), and increases in PNN intensity in the IL-PFC of SD and OP females in the absence of changes in other regions.

While circadian rhythms in both behavior and physiological activity can be entrained in animals via meal-feeding schedules, the mechanism by which this occurs remains poorly understood.

Additionally, the choice to consume a highly palatable food following exposure to a stressor results in reduced corticosterone levels. To test the effects of intermittent access to a high sugar/high fat food on stress hormone levels, rats were given either unrestricted (UR) access to a sucrose-vegetable shortening mixture (SVS) or 2 hour SVS access 7 days (7D) or 3 days (3D) per week for 4 weeks. Rats on the UR and 3D schedules consumed significantly more calories per day than did controls with no access to SVS, and the 7D and 3D rats consumed as many SVS calories in the 2 hour access period as did the UR rats with 24 hour access to SVS. After 4 weeks of access to SVS (UR, 7D, and 3D), rats were briefly restrained. Control and UR rats had elevated corticosterone during and following restraint, whereas there were no differences in corticosterone levels of 7D and 3D rats in response to restraint, as compared to baseline. Post-restraint consumption of chow was significantly decreased in all groups, and consumption of SVS was reduced in the UR, but not the 7D and 3D rats. These data demonstrate that intermittent access to SVS dampens the corticosterone response to restraint stress and that stressful events do not induce bingeing in non-bingeing animals with access to a high sucrose/high fat food.","Binge-type eating attenuates corticosterone and hypophagic responses to restraint stress.","Physiology & behavior","Kinzig KP and Hargrave SL and Honors MA","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc)",-1,2021-03-18 19:42:25,-1,2021-02-20 20:17:53,1,2021-02-26 14:39:25,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The behaviour was studied in actimeter, in open field and after food and water deprivation. Corticosterone plasma levels were quantified after food and water deprivation. The effects of L365,260 were studied in the behavioural changes observed in D rats. RESULTS: No differences in circadian motor activity between non-deprived (ND) and D rats were observed. D rats showed a 50% decrease in their number of visits to the central (aversive) part of the open field compared to ND rats. This effect was suppressed by L365,260. After 20 h of food and water deprivation, an increase in plasma corticosterone was observed in D and ND rats. However, the raise of corticosterone secretion in D rats was dramatically increased (300%) compared to ND rats, indicating a hypersensitised state revealed by this stressful situation. Consumption of sucrose solution (1%) was higher for D rats than for ND rats after food and water deprivation. Sucrose consumption returned to control values following L365,260 treatment.

The progression of estrous cycling, the functional relevance of estrogen signaling for binge feeding, and binge-induced changes in food motivation were measured. RESULTS: Female rats developed a binge pattern of feeding that included alternation between caloric overconsumption and compensatory voluntary restriction without impacting estrous cycling. Notably, rats that received daily HFD exposure progressively decreased binge meals. Estrogen replacement in normal cycling or ovariectomized rats mimicked the reduction in body weight in female rats that received daily HFD access. Operant responding was unaffected by binge feeding; however, estrogen augmented operant performance in HFD-exposed rats.

In recently developed animal models of binge eating, rats given intermittent access to such food escalate their consumption over time. Consumption of calorie-dense food is associated with neurochemical changes in the nucleus accumbens, including dopamine release and alterations in dopamine and opioid receptor expression. Therefore, we hypothesized that binge-like consumption on intermittent access schedules is dependent on opioid and/or dopamine neurotransmission in the accumbens. To test this hypothesis, we asked whether injection of dopamine and opioid receptor antagonists into the core and shell of the accumbens reduced consumption of a sweet high-fat liquid in rats with and without a history of intermittent binge access to the liquid. Although injection of a mu opioid agonist increased consumption, none of the antagonists (including mu opioid, delta opioid, kappa opioid, D1 dopamine and D2 dopamine receptor antagonists, as well as the broad-spectrum opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone) reduced consumption, and this was the case whether or not the animals had a prior history of intermittent access.

This neuroanatomical position is consistent with a potential role of this nucleus to regulate ingestive and motivated behavior. Here neuroanatomical, molecular, and behavior approaches are utilized to determine whether SuM contributes to ingestive and food-motivated behavior control. METHODS: Through the application of anterograde and retrograde neural tract tracing with novel designer viral vectors, the current findings show that SuM neurons densely innervate the LH in a sex dimorphic fashion. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a clinically targeted neuro-intestinal hormone with a well-established role in regulating energy balance and reward behaviors. Here we determine that GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1R) are expressed throughout the SuM of both sexes, and also directly on SuM LH-projecting neurons and investigate the role of SuM GLP-1R in the regulation of ingestive and motivated behavior in male and female rats. RESULTS: SuM microinjections of the GLP-1 analogue, exendin-4, reduced ad libitum intake of chow, fat, or sugar solution in both male and female rats, while food-motivated behaviors, measured using the sucrose motivated operant conditioning test, was only reduced in male rats. These data contrasted with the results obtained from a neighboring structure well known for its role in motivation and reward, the VTA, where females displayed a more potent response to GLP-1R activation by exendin-4. In order to determine the physiological role of SuM GLP-1R signaling regulation of energy balance, we utilized an adeno-associated viral vector to site-specifically deliver shRNA for the GLP-1R to the SuM. Surprisingly, and in contrast to previous results for the two SuM neighboring sites, LH and VTA, SuM GLP-1R knockdown increased food seeking and adiposity in obese male rats without altering food intake, body weight or food motivation in lean or obese, female or male rats. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results indicate that SuM potently contributes to ingestive and motivated behavior control; an effect contingent on sex, diet/homeostatic energy balance state and behavior of interest. These data also extend the map of brain sites directly responsive to GLP-1 agonists, and highlight key differences in the role that GLP-1R play in interconnected and neighboring nuclei.","GLP-1 modulates the supramammillary nucleus-lateral hypothalamic neurocircuit to control ingestive and motivated behavior in a sex divergent manner.","Molecular metabolism","Lopez-Ferreras L and Eerola K and Mishra D and Shevchouk OT and Richard JE and Nilsson FH and Hayes MR and Skibicka KP","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-27 21:04:30,-1,2021-03-12 00:56:19,,,,,,,,

It has been proposed that compulsive eating may develop as a form of self-medication to alleviate the negative emotional state associated with withdrawal from highly palatable foods. This study was aimed at determining whether withdrawal from chronic, intermittent access to a highly palatable food was responsible for the emergence of depressive-like behavior. For this purpose, a group of male Wistar rats was provided a regular chow diet 7 days a week (Chow/Chow), whereas a second group of rats was provided chow for 5 days a week, followed by a 2-day access to a highly palatable sucrose diet (Chow/Palatable). Following 7 weeks of diet alternation, depressive-like behavior was assessed during withdrawal from the highly palatable diet and following renewed access to it, using the forced swim test, the sucrose consumption test, and the intracranial self-stimulation threshold procedure. It was found that Chow/Palatable rats withdrawn from the highly palatable diet showed increased immobility time in the forced swim test and decreased sucrose intake in the sucrose consumption test compared with the control Chow/Chow rats. Interestingly, the increased immobility in the forced swim test was abolished by renewing access to the highly palatable diet. No changes were observed in the intracranial self-stimulation threshold procedure.

The goal of this study was to determine if impulsive choice predicted, or was altered by binge-like eating of a sugary, highly palatable diet. We utilized a modified adjusting delay task procedure in free-fed rats to assess impulsive choice behavior, that is. the tendency to respond for a larger, delayed reward over a lesser, immediate reward. We found that baseline impulsive choice was not a predictor of binge-like eating in 1-h sessions of palatable diet operant self-administration. Furthermore, binge-like eating of the same palatable diet had no effect on later impulsive choice behavior.

However, Fmr1-KO mice have more bouts of activity during the light cycle compared with wild types.

However, the functional interaction of ligand and receptor is not very well understood. We demonstrate that GHSR mRNA is up-regulated after food deprivation (48 h) in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus and ventromedial nucleus of the seasonal Siberian hamster, Phodopus sungorus. This increase is accompanied by a two-fold elevation of circulating ghrelin concentration. Chronic changes in feeding state imposed by food restriction over a period of 12 weeks during long day-length induced increased GHSR gene expression, whereas food restriction for 6 weeks had no effect. Phodopus sungorus reveals remarkable seasonal changes in body weight, fat mass and circulating leptin levels. Ghrelin is generally regarded as having opposing effects on appetite and body weight with respect to those exhibited by leptin. However, our study revealed that seasonal adaptations were not accompanied by changes in either GHSR gene expression or circulating ghrelin concentration. Therefore, we suggest that ghrelin only plays a minor role in modulating long-term seasonal body weight cycles.

The consequences of this early stress have been demonstrated on various behaviors, including feeding behavior. The results, however, are still controversial and it seems that a second exposure to stress later in life exacerbates the adverse outcomes. The present study aimed to determine the effects of maternal separation as a model of stress in early life, with or without a later life stress experience on eating behavior. Lactating Wistar rats were separated from their litters from postnatal day 2 (PND 2) to PND 14 for 3 h in the dark phase of the circadian cycle. The groups control (C) and separated (S) were composed. The assessment of food intake was performed between the ages of 60 and 150 days of life with a group that experienced only the early stress by maternal separation and with a second group that experienced the pre-weaning maternal separation stress and the food stress from 60 days of age. This food stress consisted of allowing visual and olfactory exposure of the animals to palatable food but did not allow the feeding. Maternal separation promoted higher palatable food and lower standard diet intake only after a double exposure to stress. Besides, the double exposure to stress promoted weight loss and an anxiety-like behavior. These outcomes were associated with a resistance to the anorectic effects of fluoxetine suggesting an alteration of the serotonergic system. Together, these findings indicate that maternal separation stress has long-lasting consequences on eating behavior, and that the dual exposure to stress seems more harmful to eating behavior outcomes. In addition, the results suggest that the serotonergic system is one candidate as the system mediating these alterations.","Dual exposure to stress in different stages of development affects eating behavior of male Wistar rats.","Physiology & behavior","de Souza JA and do Amaral Almeida LC and Tavares GA and Falcao LAL and Beltrao LC and Costa FCO and de Souza FL and da Silva MC and de Souza SL","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 14:37:57,-1,2021-02-26 14:44:05,,,,,,,,

Of note, many brain disorders are associated with impairments in cognitive flexibility. Several classical neurotransmitter systems including dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline are shown to be important for cognitive flexibility, however, there is not much known about the role of neuropeptides. The neuropeptide orexin, which is brain-widely released by neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, is a major player in maintaining sleep/wake cycle, feeding behavior, arousal, and motivational behavior. Recent studies showed a role of orexin in attention, cognition and stress-induced attenuation of cognitive flexibility by disrupting orexin signaling locally or systemically. However, it is not known so far whether brain-wide reduction or loss of orexin affects cognitive flexibility. We investigated this question by testing male and female orexin-deficient mice in the attentional set shifting task (ASST), an established paradigm of cognitive flexibility. We found that orexin deficiency impaired the intra-dimensional shift phase of the ASST selectively in female homozygous orexin-deficient mice and improved the first reversal learning phase selectively in male homozygous orexin-deficient mice. We also found that these orexin-mediated sex-based modulations of cognitive flexibility were not correlated with trait anxiety, narcoleptic episodes, and reward consumption. Our findings highlight a sexually dimorphic role of orexin in regulating cognitive flexibility and the need for further investigations of sex-specific functions of the orexin circuitry.","Orexin deficiency modulates cognitive flexibility in a sex-dependent manner.","Genes, brain, and behavior","Durairaja A and Fendt M","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-27 20:53:08,-1,2021-03-11 03:52:08,,,,,,,,

We tested the hypothesis that context cues surrounding palatable food (PF) intake have the power to disrupt caloric regulation even of less PF. Context cues are non-food cues that are in the environment where PF is habitually eaten. DESIGN: Rats were conditioned to associate intake of Oreo cookies as the PF to cages with distinct context cues that differed from cues in cages where they were only given chow. PF naturally stimulated greater caloric intake. The rats were then tested in the PF cage with only chow available to determine whether the PF-paired cues, alone, could elicit overeating of plain chow. SUBJECTS: Non-food-deprived female Sprague-Dawley rats. MEASUREMENTS: Intake of plain chow under PF-paired cues vs chow-paired cues was compared. This was also measured in tests that included a morsel of PF as a priming stimulus. We also controlled for any effect of binge-prone vs binge-resistant status to predict cued-overeating. RESULTS: Rats consumed significantly more chow when exposed to context cues paired earlier with PF than with chow (P<0.01). This effect occurred using various cues (for example, different types of bedding or wallpaper). The effect was strengthened by priming with a morsel of PF (P<0.001) and was unaffected by baseline differences in propensity to binge on PF. CONCLUSION: Context-cues associated with PF intake can drive overeating even of a less PF and abolish the ability of rats to compensate for the calories of a PF primer. Just as drug-associated context cues can reinstate drug-addiction relapse, PF-paired cues may trigger overeating relapses linked to weight regain and obesity. This model should help identify the reflex-like biology that sabotages attempts to adhere to healthy reduced calorie regimens and call greater attention to the cue-factor in the treatment of binge eating and obesity.","The Pavlovian power of palatable food: lessons for weight-loss adherence from a new rodent model of cue-induced overeating.","International journal of obesity (2005)","Boggiano MM and Dorsey JR and Thomas JM and Murdaugh DL","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 19:43:27,-1,2021-02-26 14:44:54,,,,,,,,

The present study describes string-pulling by the mouse, a behavior in which a mouse uses hand-over-hand movements to pull down a string that hangs from the top of a test cage. Mice both spontaneously string-pull and also string-pull to obtain cashew nuts tied to the end of the string as food reward. To string-pull, mice sat upright and tracked the string with their nose and then made hand-over-hand movements to reel in the string. A string-pull movement consists of four arm movements (Advance to make purchase, Pull, Push to draw the string down and Lift to return the hand for the next Advance) and four hand movements (Collect to aim the hand, Overgrasp to position the hand, and Grasp to make purchase, and Release). The kinematic profiles of the string-pull movement are distinctive with each hand making similar movements at a rate of 4 cycles per second and with the Lift and Advance movements occurring at a higher speed than Pull and Push movements. The results are discussed in relation to the antecedent repertoire of mouse behavior that lends itself to string-pulling, with respect to the utility of using string-pulling to investigate motor systems and adapting string-pulling to model neurological conditions in mice.","The structure of arm and hand movements in a spontaneous and food rewarded on-line string-pulling task by the mouse.","Behavioural brain research","Blackwell AA and Banovetz MT and Qandeel and Whishaw IQ and Wallace DG","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-24 19:31:19,-1,2021-02-27 15:50:56,,,,,,,,

Undernourished animals had a lower response to the anticonflict effect of diazepam when compared to control rats.

All rats responded to phase delays of 4 or 6 hr with an increase in the duration of anticipatory activity so that transients appeared mostly in activity onset. Following 8 hr phase delays, clear delaying transients in both activity onset and end were observed. Only a few rats showed advancing transients in activity after phase advances of food access. In response to 6 hr and 8 hr phase advances, 3 different responses occurred: (a) activity re-entrained to food access by the 2nd or 3rd day without clear intervening transients, (b) activity phase shifted by means of distinct delaying transients and (c) delaying transients occurred in one component of activity while a second component of activity appeared at the new phase position by the second or third day.

These effects were not reproduced by intra-PFC infusion of a variety of dopamine (DA) agonists and antagonists, suggesting that manipulation of intra-PFC DA systems alone is not sufficient to reproduce muOR-like effects. Nevertheless, this does not rule out interactions between PFC DA and mu-opioid systems. Here we used intra-vmPFC drug cocktails containing DAMGO and SCH 23390 (a DA D1 receptor antagonist) to determine whether increases in appetitive motivation and motor activity elicited by intra-vmPFC muOR stimulation require intact signaling through vmPFC D1 receptors. Blockade of D1 receptors with SCH 23390 attenuated the enhancement of PR breakpoint, and increases in exploratory-like behavior and feeding initiation elicited by intra-vmPFC muOR stimulation. These results establish that intra-vmPFC D1 signaling is required for the expression of behavioral effects evoked by muOR stimulation within the PFC, and further suggest that D1 tone plays an enabling or permissive role in the expression of muOR -elicited effects. Simultaneous targeting of both mu-opioid and D1 systems may represent a more efficacious treatment strategy (compared to muOR blockade alone) for psychiatric disorders characterized by dysregulated appetitive motivation.","Modulation of appetitive motivation by prefrontal cortical mu-opioid receptors is dependent upon local dopamine D1 receptor signaling.","Neuropharmacology","Selleck RA and Giacomini J and Buchholtz BD and Lake C and Sadeghian K and Baldo BA","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 22:55:41,-1,2021-02-26 14:57:36,,,,,,,,

However, other work suggests that opioids increase intake of fat specifically. The present study further investigates the role of PVN opioids in food choices made by calorically-replete animals. We used a binge model with chow-maintained rats given 3-h access to a choice of a high-fat or high-sucrose diet 3 days a week. We hypothesized that intra-PVN injection of the mu-opioid agonist, DAMGO (0, 0.025, 0.25, and 2.5 nmol) would enhance, and NTX (0, 10, 30, and 100 nmol) would inhibit intake of both diets to an equal extent. We found that when animals were divided into groups according to sucrose or fat preference, DAMGO increased fat intake in fat-consuming animals, while having no effect on intake of either diet in sucrose-consuming animals. NTX, however, inhibited fat intake in both groups. Intra-PVN NTX did not inhibit intake of sucrose when presented in the absence of a fat choice, but did so when injected peripherally. Furthermore, intra-PVN and systemic NTX inhibited intake of chow by 24-h-food-deprived animals.

In the presence of an entraining light-dark (LD) cycle, however, the entraining effects of nonphotic stimuli on (parts of) the circadian oscillator are far less clear. Yet, an interesting finding is that appropriately timed exercise after a phase shift can accelerate the entrainment of circadian rhythms to the new LD cycle in both rodents and humans.

Animals were adapted to RF with 2-h food access at the projected time of the new dark onset. Before and at several time points after the 8-h phase advance, nocturnal melatonin profiles were measured in RF animals and animals on ad libitum feeding (AL). In LD-entrained conditions, RF did not cause any significant changes in the nocturnal melatonin profile as compared to AL. Unexpectedly, after the 8-h phase advance, RF animals resynchronized more slowly to the new LD cycle than AL animals. These results indicate that prior entrainment to a nonphotic stimulus such as RF may 'phase lock' the circadian oscillator and in that way hinder resynchronization after a phase shift.","Restricted daytime feeding attenuates reentrainment of the circadian melatonin rhythm after an 8-h phase advance of the light-dark cycle.","Journal of biological rhythms","Kalsbeek A and Barassin S and van Heerikhuize JJ and van der Vliet J and Buijs RM","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-27 21:11:27,-1,2021-03-12 01:01:16,,,,,,,,

However, whether olfactory associative learning acquired early in the adult stage of insects affect memorizing of new learning events has not been studied yet. METHODOLOGY: Groups of adult honeybee workers that experienced an odor paired with a sucrose solution 5 to 8 days or 9 to 12 days after emergence were previously exposed to (i) a rewarded experience through the offering of scented food, or (ii) a non-rewarded experience with a pure volatile compound in the rearing environment. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Early rewarded experiences (either at 1-4 or 5-8 days of adult age) enhanced retention performance in 9-12-day-conditioned bees when they were tested at 17 days of age. The highest retention levels at this age, which could not be improved with prior rewarded experiences, were found for memories established at 5-8 days of adult age. Associative memories acquired at 9-12 days of age showed a weak effect on retention for some pure pre-exposed volatile compounds; whereas the sole exposure of an odor at any younger age did not promote long-term effects on learning performance. CONCLUSIONS: The associative learning events that occurred a few days after adult emergence improved memorizing in middle-aged bees. In addition, both the timing and the nature of early sensory inputs interact to enhance retention of new learning events acquired later in life, an important matter in the social life of honeybees.","Associative learning during early adulthood enhances later memory retention in honeybees.","PloS one","Arenas A and Fernandez VM and Farina WM","study with other mammals other than rat mice,study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-02-24 19:21:12,-1,2021-02-27 15:51:37,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to evaluate the importance of individual daily habits to a freeliving animal, foraging behaviour of kestrels was observed continuously for days in sequence in open country. Data obtained in 2,942 observation hours were used. Flight-hunting was the prominent foraging technique yielding 76% of all prey obtained. 2. Flight-hunting was impeded by rain, fog and wind speeds below 4 m/s and above 12 m/s (Fig. 3). Flight-hunting tended to be suppressed also in response to recent successful strikes and more generally by a high level of post-dawn accumulated prey (Figs. 4, 5). Flight-hunting had a tendency to be enhanced in response to recent unsuccessful strikes (Fig. 6). 3. Trapping results demonstrated a fine-grained daily pattern of common vole trap entries, with peaks at intervals of ca. 2 h (Figs. 7, 8). The interpretation of some of this pattern as representative of vole surface activity was supported by overall strike frequencies of kestrels hunting for voles (Fig. 9). 4. Detailed analysis of the behaviour of three individuals revealed significant peaks in hunting yield and frequency, coinciding with each other and with peaks in vole trapping (Fig. 11). It is suggested that the kestrels adjusted their flight-hunting sessions to times of high 'expected' yield. Vole activity peaks sometimes remained unexploited. 5. Meal frequencies culminated shortly before nightfall except in incubating females. The difference between the daily distributions of hunting and eating was due to some of the prey being cached in daytime and retrieved around dusk (Fig. 13). Caching behaviour is interpreted as a circadian strategy allowing separate optimization of hunting-adjusted to prey availability-and eating-adaptive by retaining minimum body weight in daytime flight and by thermo-regulatory savings at night. 6. Some kestrels showed remarkable constancy from day to day in the temporal distribution of specific behaviours (Fig. 16) and of spatial movements (Figs. 18, 19). In three 1-2 week sequences of observation analysed, flight-hunting frequency peaked 24 h after prey capture (Fig. 17). This is probably based on day to day correlations in flight-hunting frequency as well as on increased motivation for hunting in response to prey capture 24 h ago (Table 5). 7. In one individual with three distinct hunting areas, the tendency to return to an area again was maximal 24 h after prey capture in that area (Fig. 21, Table 6). A field experiment tested the effect of prey capture on the daily distributions of hunting and site choice in this individual (Fig. 22). A significant concentration of flight-hunting activity in the experimental feeding area was observed at the daily time of feeding (Fig. 23). Two alternative hypotheses are compatible with the result. Favoured is the one that the birds use 'time memory' for the optimization of their daily patterns of flight-hunting and site choice. 8. By adjusting her daily flight-hunting to times of high yield, one kestrel saved 10-22% on her total time spent flight-hunting. Maximal efficiency, by concentration of all hunting activity in the hour of maximal yield, was not attained, presumably because of information constraints. The generality of the contribution of daily habits to survival is discussed.","Hunting in the kestrel, Falco tinnunculus, and the adaptive significance of daily habits.","Oecologia","Rijnsdorp A and Daan S and Dijkstra C","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-02-24 19:29:31,-1,2021-02-27 15:51:48,,,,,,,,

Binge-like eating was elicited by three cycles of 4 days of food restriction and 4 days of free feeding followed by a single frustrative nonreward-stress episode (15 min visual and olfactory exposure to a familiar palatable food) immediately before presentation of the palatable food. Intact rats showed binge-like eating during the diestrous and proestrous phases of the ovarian cycle, but not during the estrous (periovulatory) phase. Ovariectomized (OVX) rats not treated with estradiol (E2) displayed binge-like eating, whereas E2-treated OVX rats did not. The procedure did not increase signs of anxiety in an open-field test. OVX rats not treated with E2 that were subjected to food restriction and sacrificed immediately after frustrative nonreward had increased numbers of cells expressing phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN), and dorsal and ventral bed nuclei of the stria terminalis (BNST) compared with nonrestricted or E2-treated rats. These data suggest that this female rat model is appropriate for mechanistic studies of some aspects of menstrual-cycle effects on emotional and binge eating in human females, that anxiety is not a sufficient cause of binge-like eating, and that the PVN, CeA, and BNST may contribute to information processing underlying binge-like eating.","Estrogenic suppression of binge-like eating elicited by cyclic food restriction and frustrative-nonreward stress in female rats.","The International journal of eating disorders","Micioni Di Bonaventura MV and Lutz TA and Romano A and Pucci M and Geary N and Asarian L and Cifani C","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc)",-1,,-1,2021-02-20 20:32:16,-1,2021-02-26 14:59:12,,,,,,,,

Under RFS, animals develop food anticipatory activity (FAA), characterized by arousal and increased locomotion. Food availability in nature is not precise, which suggests that animals need to adjust their food-associated activity on a daily basis. This study explored the capacity of rats to adjust to variable and unpredictable feeding schedules. Rats were exposed either to RFS with fixed daily meal (RF) or to a variable meal time (VAR) during the light phase. RF and VAR rats exhibited daily metabolic oscillations driven by the last meal event; however, VAR rats were not able to show a robust adjustment in the anticipating corticosterone peak. VAR rats were unable to exhibit FAA but exhibited a daily activation pattern in phase with the previous meal. In both groups the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus and arcuate nucleus, involved in energy balance, exhibited increased c-Fos expression 24 h after the last meal, while only RF rats exhibited low c-Fos expression in the SCN. Data show that metabolic and behavioural food-entrained rhythms can be reset on a daily basis; the two conditions elicit a similar hypothalamic response, while only the SCN is inhibited in rats exhibiting anticipatory activity.

These conditions induce high levels of wheel running and rapid weight loss. Although this procedure was developed as an animal model of anorexia nervosa, it has been studied primarily in male rats. Our goal was to examine the development of, and recovery from, activity-based anorexia in female rats. Food intake, wheel running, body weight, and phase of the estrous cycle were monitored daily prior to, during, and after a period of restricted feeding in which access to food was limited to 2 h/day. Food intake, body weight, and estrous cyclicity were also monitored in a control group housed without access to running wheels. Prior to food restriction, rats with wheels displayed high levels of wheel running and consumed more food than rats without wheels. Despite that both groups consumed similar amounts of food during the restricted-feeding phase, only rats with wheels developed symptoms of activity-based anorexia, including increased wheel running, rapid weight loss, and disruptions in estrous cyclicity. Recovery from activity-based anorexia was associated with hypoactivity and hyperphagia. Resumption of estrous cycles occurred when the weight lost during food restriction was regained. Hyperphagia, but not hypoactivity, was maintained following resumption of estrous cycles; however, this hyperphagia was limited to nonestrous phases. Our findings suggest that recovery from activity-based anorexia is mediated primarily by an increase in orexigenic signaling that promotes pronounced hyperphagia, and that the increase in satiogenic signaling during estrus abolishes this compensatory hyperphagia.","Development of, and recovery from, activity-based anorexia in female rats.","Physiology & behavior","Dixon DP and Ackert AM and Eckel LA","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 23:00:35,-1,2021-03-01 19:35:24,,,,,,,,

Research suggests that inflammation plays a role in the onset and maintenance of eating-related maladaptive behavior. Markers of inflammation can be selectively altered in discrete brain regions where they can directly or indirectly regulate food intake. In the present study, we measured expression levels of different components of cytokine systems (IL-1, IL-6, IL-18, TNF-alpha and IFN-) and related molecules (iNOS and COX2) in the preoptic and anterior-tuberal parts of the hypothalamus of a validated animal model of binge eating. In this animal model, based on the exposure to both food restriction and frustration stress, binge-like eating behavior for highly palatable food is not shown when animals are exposed to the frustration stress during the estrus phase. We found a characteristic down-regulation of the IL-18/IL-18 receptor system (with increased expression of the inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-18, IL-18BP, together with a decreased expression of the binding chain of the IL-18 receptor) and a three-fold increase in the expression of iNOS specifically in the anterior-tuberal region of the hypothalamus of animals that develop a binge-like eating behavior. Differently, when food restricted animals were stressed during the estrus phase, IL-18 expression increased, while iNOS expression was not significantly affected. Considering the role of this region of the hypothalamus in controlling feeding related behavior, this can be relevant in eating disorders and obesity. Our data suggest that by targeting centrally selected inflammatory markers, we may prevent that disordered eating turns into a full blown eating disorder.","Hypothalamic expression of inflammatory mediators in an animal model of binge eating.","Behavioural brain research","Alboni S and Micioni Di Bonaventura MV and Benatti C and Giusepponi ME and Brunello N and Cifani C","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 19:06:02,-1,2021-03-01 19:36:12,,,,,,,,

The dependence of these correlates upon the presence of a reward was studied by comparing the behavioral correlates observed when the presence of the reward was manipulated within a single behavioral session. Rats were well-trained on a continuous reinforcement instrumental task reinforced by 0.1 ml drops of 5% sucrose. Extracellular single-unit neural activity was recorded from electrode arrays implanted into the NAC when instrumental behavior was and then was not reinforced with sucrose (within-session extinction). A variable delay between the instrumental response and the sucrose delivery allowed for separation of neural activity related to these task events. A spike activity increase around the time of the instrumental response was the most common behavioral correlate, while a decrease in spike activity upon sucrose delivery was the second most common behavioral correlate. Following removal of the reinforcer, subjects continued to perform the instrumental response, allowing for the examination of response-related spike activity under extinction conditions in which the response was no longer reinforced by sucrose. A majority of the response-related neural activity patterns were lost when sucrose was no longer available. New neural responses also were detected during this period. For some subjects, the reinforcer was again made available during the same session. Encoding of the primary behavioral events during this period of reinstated reinforcer was similar, but not identical, to that observed during the first period of reinforced responding. These findings reveal that instrumental task-associated spike activity within the NAC is partially dependent upon the presence of the reinforcer, and that encoding across the population is distinct under reinforced and extinction conditions.","Dynamics of neural coding in the accumbens during extinction and reinstatement of rewarded behavior.","Behavioural brain research","Janak PH and Chen MT and Caulder T","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 14:42:04,-1,2021-03-01 19:37:08,,,,,,,,

Binge eating is associated with a significant loss of control over palatable food (PF) intake, and deficits in behavioral control mechanisms, subserved by the prefrontal cortex (PFC), may underlie binge eating. Few studies, to date, have examined whether the PFC is directly involved in the expression of binge eating. As such, the present study investigated the functional role of the medial PFC (mPFC) in PF consumption, using an individual differences rat model of binge eating proneness. Here, we tested the hypothesis that binge eating proneness (i.e., high levels of PF consumption) is associated with reduced mPFC-mediated behavioral control over PF intake. In experiment 1, we quantified PF-induced Fos expression in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons within the mPFC in binge eating prone (BEP) and binge eating resistant (BER) female rats. In experiment 2, we pharmacologically inactivated the mPFC of BEP and BER female rats, just prior to PF exposure, and subsequently quantified PF intake and scores of feeding behavior. While most Fos-expressing neurons of the mPFC in both BEPs and BERs were of the excitatory phenotype, fewer excitatory neurons were engaged by PF in BEPs than in BERs. Moreover, pharmacological inactivation of the mPFC led to a significant increase in PF intake in both BEPs and BERs, but the rise in PF consumption was stronger in BEPs than in BERs. Thus, these data suggest that lower, PF-induced excitatory tone in the mPFC of BEP rats may lead to a weaker, mPFC-mediated behavioral 'brake' over excessive PF intake.","Reduced Medial Prefrontal Control of Palatable Food Consumption Is Associated With Binge Eating Proneness in Female Rats.","Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience","Sinclair EB and Klump KL and Sisk CL","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 19:22:38,-1,2021-03-01 19:37:48,,,,,,,,

Photoperiodicity affected testosterone levels, as under LD-acclimation, levels were significantly (p<0.05) higher than under SD-acclimation. Salinity treatment (ST) significantly reduced SD-acclimated male body mass (W(b)) and testis mass (p<0.005; normalized to W(b)).

Our results suggest that photoperiod serves as an initial signal while water availability, expressed by increased salinity in the water source, is an ultimate cue for regulation of reproduction, in both sexes of desert-adapted A. cahirinus. We assume that environmental changes also affect behavior, as water seeking behavior by selecting food items, or locomotor activity may change in extreme environment, and thus indirectly affect reproduction and reproductive behavior.

The immediate consequence of the neurotoxin lesion was a dramatic increase in 24-hr food intake, attributed predominantly to a preferential increase in carbohydrate and fat consumption. The long-term effects related to CA depletion were a deficit in daily food consumption, particularly of carbohydrate (-42%). Although animals with diminished PVN NE maintained a normal diurnal feeding pattern, they failed to exhibit the increased ingestion of an energy-rich carbohydrate diet which rats normally show during the dark period of the diurnal cycle.

Rats with the briefest access had the greatest binge-like (2-h) intake, did not lose weight on weekends despite undereating chow, and were fattier by 12 weeks. Extended access rats (8h) showed the greatest daily intake of preferred food and corresponding undereating of chow, slower weight gain when PREF was unavailable, and more variable daily energy intake from week to week. Increased fasting glucose was seen in 2-h and 8-h access rats. During acute withdrawal from PREF to chow diet, restricted access rats showed increased locomotor activity. Thus, intermittent access broadly promoted weight gain, fasting hyperglycemia and psychomotor arousal during early withdrawal. More restricted access promoted greater binge-like intake and fat accumulation, whereas longer access promoted evidence of greater food reward tolerance.","The duration of intermittent access to preferred sucrose-rich food affects binge-like intake, fat accumulation, and fasting glucose in male rats.","Appetite","Kreisler AD and Mattock M and Zorrilla EP","",1,,1,2021-02-20 20:12:44,1,2021-03-01 19:40:32,,,,,,,,

Drinking behaviour after water deprivation is one of the standard tests used to study thirst in humans and animals. Diurnal cycle and food availability are known to influence water intake, but have not been considered in previous studies of thirst after water deprivation. In the present study, we examined the effects of diurnal variation and food availability on water intake after 24 h water deprivation in rats. 2. All rats cycled through four treatments in varying order. These treatments were: (i) 24 h water deprivation with free access to food from 1900 h one day to 1900 h the next day, followed by free access to both food and water (Night-with-Food); (ii) 24 h water deprivation with free access to food from from 1900 h one day to 1900 h the next day, followed by free access to water but not food (Night-without-Food); (iii) 24 h water deprivation with free access to food from 0700 h one day to 0700 h the next day, followed by free access to both food and water (Day-with-Food); or (iv) 24 h water deprivation with free access to food from 0700 h one day to 0700 h the next day, followed by free access to water but not food (Day-without-Food). The amount of water consumed during the first 6 h, post-24 h water deprivation, was examined under each condition. 3. There was a significant diurnal effect (P < 0.001) and a significant food availability effect (P = 0.007) on the water consumed in the 6 h period after water deprivation. Most water was consumed by the Night-with-Food group and the least amount of water was consumed by the Day-without-Food group. These effects persisted after correction for water intake during 6 h periods from 0700 and 1900 h with and without food but without previous water deprivation. The diurnal and food availability effects on water consumption were independent (P = 0.5). 4. The coefficient of variability for each group suggests that the most sensitive measurements of water intake are obtained during the day in the absence of food. 5. We conclude that both the time of day and access to food independently alter water intake in rats subjected to a previous 24 h water deprivation. Our study also supports the validity of performing water intake measurements in thirst studies in rats during the day.","Time of day and access to food alter water intake in rats after water deprivation.","Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology","Ang KK and McKitrick DJ and Phillips PA and Arnolda LF","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 23:04:51,-1,2021-03-01 19:41:38,,,,,,,,

Head-entries were reinforced in the second half of a stimulus (s1) and in the first half of a different stimulus (s2). During extinction, response times shifted earlier in s2 only, contrary to BeT.

However, little is known about the effects of nighttime restricted feeding. Previously, we showed that daytime restricted access to a highly palatable complete meal replacement, Ensure Plus (Ensure), shifts the rhythm of expression of the clock protein PER2 in limbic forebrain areas including the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTov), central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA), basolateral amygdala (BLA) and dentate gyrus (DG), and induces a rhythm in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH) in food deprived (restricted feeding), but not free-fed rats (restricted treat). In the present study we investigated the effects of nighttime restricted feeding (Ensure only, 2 h/night) and nighttime restricted treats (Ensure 2 h/night+free access to chow) in order to determine whether these effects were dependent on the time of day the meal was provided. We found that nighttime restricted feeding, like daytime restricted feeding, shifted the rhythm of PER2 expression in the BNSTov and CEA and peak expression was observed approximately 12 h after the mealtime. Also consistent with previous work, nighttime restricted feeding induced a rhythm of PER2 expression in the DMH and these effects occurred without affecting the rhythm in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). In contrast to previous work with daytime restricted feeding, nighttime restricted feeding had no effect on PER2 rhythms in the BLA and DG. Finally, nighttime restricted treats, as was the case for daytime restricted treats, had no effect on PER2 expression in any of the brain areas studied.

One group was trained on concurrent variable-ratio 20 extinction schedules of reinforcement. The second group was trained on a concurrent variable-interval 27-s extinction schedule. In both groups, lever-schedule assignments changed randomly following reinforcement; a light cued the lever providing the next reinforcer. In the next condition, the light cue was removed and reinforcer assignment strictly alternated between levers. The next two conditions redetermined, in order, the first two conditions. Preference pulses, defined as a tendency for relative response rate to decline to the just-reinforced alternative with time since reinforcement, only appeared during the extinction schedule. Although the pulse's functional form was well described by a reinforcer-induction equation, there was a large residual between actual data and a pulse-as-artifact simulation (McLean, Grace, Pitts, & Hughes, 2014) used to discern reinforcer-dependent contributions to pulsing. However, if that simulation was modified to include a win-stay tendency (a propensity to stay on the just-reinforced alternative), the residual was greatly reduced. Additional modifications of the parameter values of the pulse-as-artifact simulation enabled it to accommodate the present results as well as those it originally accommodated. In its revised form, this simulation was used to create a model that describes response runs to the preferred alternative as terminating probabilistically, and runs to the unpreferred alternative as punctate with occasional perseverative response runs. After reinforcement, choices are modeled as returning briefly to the lever location that had been just reinforced. This win-stay propensity is hypothesized as due to reinforcer induction.","Preference pulses and the win-stay, fix-and-sample model of choice.","Journal of the experimental analysis of behavior","Hachiga Y and Sakagami T and Silberberg A","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,2021-03-18 19:51:36,1,2021-02-20 19:59:50,-1,2021-02-19 02:57:36,,,,,,,,

Animal gambling models, however, have not yet demonstrated the compulsivity so characteristic of drug addiction. Three criteria have been used to evaluate addiction-like behavior in drug models: (1) response inhibition when reward is not available, (2) persistence under a progressive ratio schedule, in which the response-to-reward ratio is stretched, and (3) persistence in spite of punishment. We tested whether prolonged exposure (6 weeks) to a gambling-like reward schedule would induce addiction-like symptoms in rats. In two studies, separate groups were trained to respond to either random- or fixed-ratio schedules for food reward. We found that rats trained on random-ratio schedules showed higher response rates and dramatically shorter pauses after rewards. Tests of addiction-like behavior, however, were largely negative. Response rates were not different during cued no-reward periods nor when reward was coupled with punishment. We also found no group differences when food was devalued nor in reinstatement of reward-seeking after a 1-week delay. The sole exception to this pattern was that rats in the second experiment showed greater persistence on a progressive ratio test. After experiment two, subjects were also orally administered pramipexole, which caused increased perseveration during progressive ratio testing, especially in the random ratio group.

The aim of this study was to test the consummatory, food microstructural, and metabolic effects of a one hour limited access to either a high-sucrose diet (HSD) or a high-fat diet (HFD) in an operant rat model of binge-like eating. METHODS: Female rats were subject to a binge-like eating procedure in which a HSD, a HFD, or a standard chow diet were provided in a fixed ratio 1 (FR1) operant schedule of reinforcement. RESULTS: Limiting access to either a HSD or a HFD promoted binge-like eating as compared to the control chow diet. However, binge-like eating of HSD, but not HFD, was based on a true increase in the amount of food consumed, an increased eating rate, and a decrease in the intake of the home-cage standard chow, altogether suggesting an increase in palatability. Moreover, while HSD rats consumed overall less energy than HFD rats, the former were more energy efficient and gained more body weight than the latter.

Adult rats received unilateral injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or vehicle in the ventromedial (vm) PFC. Behavioral tests included a predator odor burying test, elevated plus maze and sucrose consumption with simple taste aversion. Tissue analysis confirmed that vmPFCs injected with 6-OHDA were depleted of DA (75-85%) compared to controls. Burying behavior and sucrose consumption were affected only by left lesions, similarly in both sexes. However, risk assessment behaviors were affected by right lesions in opposite directions in males and females. Behaviors modified preferentially by the left cortex thus showed less evidence of sex differences than those modulated by the right.

In most mammals, circadian rhythms result in nocturnal activity patterns although plasticity of the circadian system allows activity patterns to shift to different times of day. Such plasticity is seen when food access is restricted to a few hours during the resting (light) phase resulting in food anticipatory activity (FAA) in the hours preceding food availability. The mechanisms underlying FAA are unknown but data suggest the involvement of the reward system and homeostatic regulation of metabolism. We previously demonstrated the isolated effect of metabolism by inducing diurnality in response to energetic challenges. Here the importance of reward timing in inducing daytime activity is assessed. The daily activity distribution of mice earning palatable chocolate at their preferred time by working in a running wheel was compared with that of mice receiving a timed palatable meal at noon. Mice working for chocolate (WFC) without being energetically challenged increased their total daily activity but this did not result in a shift to diurnality. Providing a chocolate meal at noon each day increased daytime activity, identifying food timing as a factor capable of altering the daily distribution of activity and rest. These results show that timing of food reward and energetic challenges are both independently sufficient to induce diurnality in nocturnal mammals. FAA observed following timed food restriction is likely the result of an additive effect of distinct regulatory pathways activated by energetic challenges and food reward.","Food reward without a timing component does not alter the timing of activity under positive energy balance.","Neuroscience","van der Vinne V and Akkerman J and Lanting GD and Riede SJ and Hut RA","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 22:53:54,-1,2021-03-02 00:06:44,,,,,,,,

Both the light-dark cycle and the timing of food intake can entrain circadian rhythms. Entrainment to food is mediated by a food entrainable circadian oscillator (FEO) that is formally and mechanistically separable from the hypothalamic light-entrainable oscillator. This experiment examined whether seasonal changes in day length affect the function of the FEO in male Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus). Hamsters housed in long (LD; 15 h light/day) or short (SD; 9h light/day) photoperiods were subjected to a timed-feeding schedule for 10 days, during which food was available only during a 5h interval of the light phase. Running wheel activity occurring within a 3h window immediately prior to actual or anticipated food delivery was operationally-defined as food anticipatory activity (FAA). After the timed-feeding interval, hamsters were fed ad libitum, and FAA was assessed 2 and 7 days later via probe trials of total food deprivation. During timed-feeding, all hamsters exhibited increases FAA, but FAA emerged more rapidly in SD; in probe trials, FAA was greater in magnitude and persistence in SD. Gonadectomy in LD did not induce the SD-like FAA phenotype, indicating that withdrawal of gonadal hormones is not sufficient to mediate the effects of photoperiod on FAA. Entrainment of the circadian system to light markedly affects the functional output of the FEO via gonadal hormone-independent mechanisms. Rapid emergence and persistent expression of FAA in SD may reflect a seasonal adaptation that directs behavior toward sources of nutrition with high temporal precision at times of year when food is scarce.","Adaptation to short photoperiods augments circadian food anticipatory activity in Siberian hamsters.","Hormones and behavior","Bradley SP and Prendergast BJ","study with other mammals other than rat mice,study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-02-26 14:51:47,-1,2021-03-02 00:07:18,,,,,,,,

However, when treated with exogenous estradiol, female rats exhibit robust renewal behavior. The current study aims to investigate whether the estrous cycle can influence renewal of appetitive behaviors and activity in brain areas known to support the renewal effect. We further aimed to examine whether the estrous cycle would similarly affect renewal of two different types of appetitive behaviors. We first establish that rats in the proestrous stage of the estrous cycle during extinction exhibit elevated renewal behavior compared with rats in either metestrous/diestrous stages, and only rats in proestrus during extinction training (but not during the renewal test) exhibit elevated renewal behavior. Furthermore, we show that this estrous cycle dependent effect on renewal only applies to the conditioned approach behavior toward the food delivery site but not the conditioned approach behavior toward the light cue associated with food delivery. Finally, we examined FOS activity within the prelimbic and infralimbic areas of the medial prefrontal cortex, the dorsal and ventral hippocampal formation, the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, the nucleus accumbens, and areas of the amygdala. Particularly in the hippocampus and amygdala, FOS expression which corresponded to the behavioral differences between groups was observed.

This work investigated whether this nocturnal hyperphagia is characterized by increased hunger, decreased postprandial satiety, or both. Rats were presented with liquid food after 3-hr food deprivation at the midpoint of the night or day phase of a 12:12 hr light/dark cycle. Quinine adulteration of food produced equal percentage suppression of first meal size (MS) and of 60-min intakes in the night and the day. This suggests that rats are equally hungry after 3-hr food deprivation in the night and the day. In contrast to apparently equal hunger, rats were less satiated by ingested food after 3 hr of food deprivation at night than during the day. This conclusion is based on the observations that the postprandial intermeal interval (IMI) was significantly shorter at night and that the satiety ratio (IMI/MS) was smaller at night. This nocturnal decrease in the satiating potency of ingested food was demonstrated for two specific preabsorptive satiety mechanisms: (a) the pregastric satiety mechanism(s) stimulated by sham feeding and (b) cholecystokinin, the putative satiety hormone released by food contacting the mucosal surface of the upper small intestine.

This capacity for reward cues to promote feeding behaviors under sated conditions can be examined in the laboratory using cue-potentiated feeding (CPF).

We examined whether deletion of the MCH receptor, MCH-1R, would in KO mice disrupt overeating in the presence of a Pavlovian CS+ associated with sucrose delivery. While both wild-type controls and KO mice showed comparable food magazine approach responses during the CPF test, MCH-1R deletion significantly impaired the ability of the CS+ to evoke overeating of sucrose under satiety. Through the use of a refined analysis of meal intake, it was revealed that this disruption to overeating behavior in KO mice reflected a reduction in the capacity for the CS+ to initiate and maintain bursts of licking behavior. These findings suggest that overeating during CPF requires intact MCH-1R signaling and may be due to an influence of the CS+ on the palatability of food and on regulatory mechanisms of peripheral control.

DESIGN: Binge-eating prone (BEP) and resistant (BER) groups were identified. Differential responses to stress, hunger, macronutrient-varied PFs, a diet-induced obesity (DIO) regimen and daily vs intermittent access to a PF+chow diet, were assessed. SUBJECTS: One hundred and twenty female Sprague-Dawley rats. MEASUREMENTS: Reliability of intake patterns within rats; food intake and body weight after various challenges over acute (1, 2, 4 h), 24-h and 2-week periods. RESULTS: Although BEP and BER rats did not differ in amount of chow consumed, BEPs consumed >50% more intermittent PF than BERs (P<0.001) and consistently so (alpha=0.86). BEPs suppressed chow but not PF intake when stressed, and ate as much when sated as when hungry. Conversely, BERs were more affected by stress and ate less PF, not chow, when stressed and were normally hyperphagic to energy deficit. BEP overeating generalized to other PFs varying in sucrose, fat and nutrition content. Half the rats in each group proved to be obesity prone after a no-choice high fat diet (DIO diet) but a continuous diet of PF+chow normalized the BEPs high drive for PF. CONCLUSION: Greater intermittent intake of PF predicts binge-eating independent of susceptibility to weight gain. Daily fat consumption in a nutritious source (DIO-diet; analogous to a fatty meal) promoted overeating and weight gain but limiting fat to daily non-nutritive food (PF+chow; analogous to a snack with a low fat meal), did not.

In this study, we hypothesized that TAAR1 may have a role in compulsive, binge-like eating; we tested this hypothesis by assessing the effects of a TAAR1 agonist, RO5256390, in multiple excessive feeding-related behaviors induced by limiting access to a highly palatable diet in rats. Our results show that RO5256390 blocked binge-like eating in rats responding 1 h per day for a highly palatable sugary diet. Consistent with a palatability-selective effect, drug treatment selectively reduced the rate and regularity of palatable food responding, but it did not affect either baseline intake or food restriction-induced overeating of the standard chow diet. Furthermore, RO5256390 fully blocked compulsive-like eating when the palatable diet was offered in an aversive compartment of a light/dark conflict box, and blocked the conditioned rewarding properties of palatable food, as well as palatable food-seeking behavior in a second-order schedule of reinforcement. Drug treatment had no effect on either anxiety-like or depressive-like behavior, and it did not affect control performance in any of the tests. Importantly, rats exposed to palatable food showed decreased TAAR1 levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and RO5256390 microinfused into the infralimbic, but not prelimbic, subregion of the mPFC-reduced binge-like eating. Altogether, these results provide evidence for TAAR1 agonism as a novel pharmacological treatment for compulsive, binge eating.","The Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1 Agonist RO5256390 Blocks Compulsive, Binge-like Eating in Rats.","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Ferragud A and Howell AD and Moore CF and Ta TL and Hoener MC and Sabino V and Cottone P","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 19:03:50,-1,2021-03-02 00:09:15,,,,,,,,

Plasma ghrelin and leptin displayed diurnal rhythms with the ghrelin peak preceding and the leptin peak following the major daily feeding peak in hour 1 after dark onset. RF reversed the diurnal rhythm of these hormones and the rhythm of rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS) and significantly altered the rhythm of Tcrt. In contrast, the duration and intensity of non-REMS (NREMS) were hardly responsive to RF. SD failed to change leptin concentrations, but it promptly stimulated plasma ghrelin and induced eating. SD elicited biphasic variations in the hypothalamic ghrelin contents. SD increased plasma corticosterone, but corticosterone did not seem to influence either leptin or ghrelin. The results suggest a strong relationship between feeding and the diurnal rhythm of leptin and that feeding also fundamentally modulates the diurnal rhythm of ghrelin.

Substitution of clonidine with saline or with clonidine and the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan resulted in extinction of responding in SNL animals. Food reinforcement was initially decreased in SNL rats self-administering clonidine compared to normal animals, however, tolerance developed to this effect of clonidine in SNL rats after 5 days.

Seasonal effects on daily activity patterns in the common vole were established by periodic trapping in the field and continuous year round recording of running wheel and freeding activity in cages exposed to natural meteorological conditions. 2. Trapping revealed decreased nocturnality in winter as compared to summer. This was paralelled by a winter reduction in both nocturnal wheel running and feeding time in cages. 3. Frequent trap checks revealed a 2 h rhythm in daytime catches in winter, not in summer. Cage feeding activity in daytime was always organized in c. 2 h intervals, but day-to-day variations in phase blurred the rhythm in summer in a summation of individual daily records. Thus both seasonal and short-term temporal patterns are consistent between field trappings and cage feeding records. 4. Variables associated with the seasonal change in daily pattern were: reproductive state (sexually active voles more nocturnal), age (juveniles more nocturnal), temperature (cold days: less nocturnal), food (indicated by feeding experiments), habitat structure (more nocturnal in habitat with underground tunnels). 5. Minor discrepancies between field trappings and cage feeding activity can be explained by assuming increased trappability of voles in winter. Cage wheel running is not predictive of field trapping patterns and is thought to reflect behavioral motivations not associated with feeding but with other activities (e.g., exploratory, escape, interactive behaviour) undetected by current methods, including radiotelemetry and passage-counting. 6.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relative contribution of satiety signals and circadian pacemakers in the control of feeding behavior. Food intake was monitored after infusion of liquid food into the stomach during several parts of the day-night cycle to prevent a possible influence of oral sensations. It is demonstrated that intragastric infusion is more effective in suppressing intake during daytime and the first half of the dark phase than during the second half of the dark phase. Suppressions of food intake are mainly due to delaying the first occurrence of food ingestion, whereas the size of that meal is less affected. During the last period of the night no significant delay could be brought about.

In Experiment 1, unlike sham-lesioned controls, rats with bilateral excitotoxic lesions of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) failed to display such cue-potentiated feeding. In Experiment 2, potentiation of feeding by an interruption signal was found to be food-specific. That is, a stimulus that signaled interruption of trials with one food but not trials with a second food later only facilitated consumption of the first food.

This food restriction regime resulted in lower maternal body weight, and in lower fetal weight on Day 20 of gestation, but did not affect fetal survival.

Plasma lactogenic activity in food-restricted animals was increased on Days 11 and 13; plasma progesterone levels were unchanged, but plasma leptin concentrations declined progressively during food restriction. Glucose tolerance was normal, suggesting that food restriction improved insulin action. On Day 20 of pregnancy, insulin responses were similar in food restricted and ad lib-fed rats; glucose tolerance was still unchanged. It thus seems that the improved insulin action as present on Day 13 had disappeared on Day 20. Also on Day 20, lactogenic activity as well as progesterone concentrations were similar in food-restricted and ad lib-fed rats.

Learned associations between food and environmental cues that predict its availability promote food-seeking behaviors. However, when such cues cease to predict food availability, animals undergo 'extinction' learning, resulting in the inhibition of food-seeking responses. Repeatedly activated sets of neurons, or 'neuronal ensembles,' in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) are recruited following appetitive conditioning and undergo physiological adaptations thought to encode cue-reward associations. However, little is known about how the recruitment and intrinsic excitability of such dmPFC ensembles are modulated by extinction learning. Here, we used in vivo 2-Photon imaging in male Fos-GFP mice that express green fluorescent protein (GFP) in recently behaviorally activated neurons to determine the recruitment of activated pyramidal and GABAergic interneuron dmPFC ensembles during extinction. During extinction, we revealed a persistent activation of a subset of interneurons which emerged from a wider population of interneurons activated during the initial extinction session. This activation pattern was not observed in pyramidal cells, and extinction learning did not modulate the excitability properties of activated pyramidal cells. Moreover, extinction learning reduced the likelihood of reactivation of pyramidal cells activated during the initial extinction session. Our findings illuminate novel neuronal activation patterns in the dmPFC underlying extinction of food-seeking, and in particular, highlight an important role for interneuron ensembles in this inhibitory form of learning.","Extinction of cue-evoked food-seeking recruits a GABAergic interneuron ensemble in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex of mice.","The European journal of neuroscience","Brebner LS and Ziminski JJ and Margetts-Smith G and Sieburg MC and Hall CN and Heintz TG and Lagnado L and Hirrlinger J and Crombag HS and Koya E","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc),no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-27 20:52:36,-1,2021-03-11 03:51:37,,,,,,,,

A total of 83 rats (23 Wistar females, 30 Sprague-Dawley females, 30 Sprague-Dawley males) completed a protocol of intermittently administered, palatable food.

Sprague-Dawley female rats consumed the highest amount of palatable food and were more likely to be classified as BEP compared to Wistar female and Sprague-Dawley male rats. Wistar female rats were not significantly different from Sprague-Dawley male rats in their palatable food intake and tendency to be classified as BER rather than BEP. Sprague-Dawley female rats appear to be a particularly vulnerable genotype for binge eating. Comparisons between this group and others could help identify specific genetic/biological factors that differentiate it from lower risk groups.

For example, most animals increase food intake when the availability of cellular metabolic fuels is low. The area postrema (AP) and adjacent, reciprocally-innervated nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) are important brain areas for metabolic control of food intake in rats. However, in Syrian hamsters, food intake is not affected by decreases in metabolic fuel availability such as those that occur with food deprivation or with pharmacological inhibitors of metabolic fuels. Hamsters make other adjustments that conserve energy when the availability of metabolic fuels is low. Estrous cycles are inhibited by treatment with a high dose of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), a drug that inhibits cellular glucose utilization, but not by treatment with methyl palmoxirate (MP) a drug that inhibits fatty acid utilization. Recent data suggest that the AP/NTS is critical for the effects of glucoprivation on estrous cycles. Lesions of the AP/NTS prevent 2DG-induced anestrus. If the AP/NTS is involved in anestrus induced by glucoprivation, it might be predicted that glucoprivic treatments that induce anestrus would change patterns of neural activation, as measured by FOS-like immunoreactivity (FOS-li), in the AP/NTS. We examined FOS-li in females that were either food deprived or fed ad libitum, and in females treated with 2DG, MP or the appropriate vehicle. FOS-li was increased in the AP/NTS only in hamsters food deprived or treated with 2DG, the two treatments that induce anestrus but have no effect on food intake.

These results suggest that the mechanism responsible for precise adjustment of water intake and meal size is disrupted by AV3V periventricular ablation. These findings indicate that AV3V periventricular tissue is critical for normal body-fluid homeostasis.","Preoptic-hypothalamic periventricular lesions after food-associated drinking and circadian rhythms.","Journal of comparative and physiological psychology","Bealer SL and Johnson AK","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-26 14:19:26,-1,2021-03-03 16:30:31,,,,,,,,

Although anhedonia diminishes over time with drug abstinence, it is not yet rather explicit whether anhedonia exists or not following protracted withdrawal. OBJECTIVES: The behavioral responses to natural rewards were examined after 2 to 3 weeks withdrawal from morphine. Male rats were pretreated with either a binge-like morphine paradigm or daily saline injection for 5 days. The consummatory and motivational behaviors for three natural rewards (sucrose solutions 4, 15, and 60%, social stimulus: male rat, and sexual stimulus: estrous female rat) were examined under varied testing conditions. RESULTS: The morphine-withdrawn rats significantly increased their intake of 15% sucrose solution during the 1-h consumption test and their operant responding for 15% sucrose solution under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement. When obtaining a reinforcer was associated with a 0.5 mA foot shock under a PR-punishment schedule, the morphine-withdrawn rats showed a higher performance for 60% sucrose solution. Meanwhile, the morphine-withdrawn rats displayed a higher motivation to sexual stimulus during the free-approach test and more approaching behaviors towards sexual stimulus in a conflict-based approach test (concurrent presence of reward and aversive stimulus). CONCLUSIONS: No anhedonia-like behavior but sensitized behaviors for natural rewards were found after long-term morphine withdrawal. Notably, the morphine-withdrawn rats displayed persistent motivated behaviors for high-value rewards (60% sucrose and sexual stimulus) in the conflict tests suggesting impairments in inhibitory control in morphine-treated rats.","The consummatory and motivational behaviors for natural rewards following long-term withdrawal from morphine: no anhedonia but persistent maladaptive behaviors for high-value rewards.","Psychopharmacology","Li Y and Zheng X and Xu N and Zhang Y and Liu Z and Bai Y","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 19:25:36,-1,2021-03-03 16:30:49,,,,,,,,

The procedure consists of the administration of a variety of ecologically relevant stressors over long durations. Its effects have been thoroughly investigated in male but not female rats. This study examines the appropriateness of stressors designed to evaluate the development and progression of depression in two strains of female rats, the effectiveness of two measures of anhedonia, and the relationship between stress reactivity and the estrous cycle. Changes in hedonic status were indexed for three weeks following a three week baseline period using two standard behavioral measures of anhedonia: sucrose intake and preference and thresholds for brain stimulation reward. Decreases in 24 h sucrose intake were observed in both strains during the first week of stress manipulations, and continued to decline thereafter for the remainder of the stress phase; in contrast, sucrose preference was unaffected by the stressors, indicating an overall reduction in fluid intake. No changes in the thresholds for brain stimulation reward were observed. The cyclical pattern of estrous was altered in both strains with a significant reduction in the number of regular cycles as a consequence of both the stressors and brain stimulation reward. Furthermore, cyclicity was not reinstated in many animals even six weeks after stress manipulations and behavioral tests had ceased. While the physiological measures suggest that the mild stressors are disruptive to female rats, the results of the behavioral tests are not consistent with the notion that the stressors induce an anhedonic state.","Behavioral and physiological effects of chronic mild stress in female rats.","Physiology & behavior","Baker SL and Kentner AC and Konkle AT and Santa-Maria Barbagallo L and Bielajew C","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 14:35:43,-1,2021-03-03 16:30:58,,,,,,,,

Dickinson and colleagues have shown that initial acquisition of instrumental responding reflects action-outcome relationships based on instrumental incentive learning, which establishes the value of an outcome. Given that the sensitivity of responding to outcome devaluation is not affected by NAc lesions, it is unlikely that incentive learning during the action-outcome phase is mediated by DA activity in the NAc. OBJECTIVES: DA efflux in the NAc after limited and extended training was compared on the assumption that comparable changes would be observed during both action-outcome- and habit-based phases of instrumental responding for food. This study also tested the hypothesis that increase in NAc DA activity is correlated with instrumental responding during extinction maintained by a conditioned stimulus paired with food. METHODS: Rats were trained to lever press for food (random-interval 30 s schedule). On the 5th and 16th day of training, microdialysis samples were collected from the NAc or mediodorsal striatum (a control site for generalized activity) during instrumental responding in extinction and then for food reward, and analyzed for DA content using high performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Increase in DA efflux in the NAc accompanied responding for food pellets on both days 5 and 16, with the magnitude of increase significantly enhanced on day 16. DA efflux was also significantly elevated during responding in extinction only on day 16.

Infected pig meat is a common risk source of toxoplasmosis. Therefore, it is important to control T. gondii infections in pigs. Improving farm management to control the introduction risk likely contributes to that aim. A pig producer only implements control measures when he or she is aware of the underlying problem, wants to solve it, and is able to solve it. If a pig producer is not implementing appropriate control measures, behavioural change interventions can be introduced to overcome constraining behavioural factors. To aid in designing behaviour change interventions, this study analysed behavioural factors of Dutch pig producers in terms of capability, opportunity and motivation to control T. gondii infections in pigs. Key risk sources analysed focused on the life cycle of T. gondii, with cats as primary host, rodents as intermediate host, and uncovered feed as an important risk source. A survey was conducted among Dutch pig producers. Responses were analysed using descriptive and cluster analysis. Results showed that around 80% of the 67 responding pig producers was aware of key risk sources of T. gondii infections in pigs. Respondents also rated risk sources that are not known to increase the risk of T. gondii infections in pigs as somewhat important. Many respondents did not know about potential consequences of a T. gondii infection in pigs on human health. Two third expected some impact on pig performance, which is incorrect because T. gondii generally does not make pigs ill. Most respondents indicated to have the motivation and opportunity to control the risk sources cats, rodents and uncovered feed. Three pig producer clusters were identified: one with higher capability to control rodents, one with lower motivation to control rodents and cats and to cover feed storages, and one with lower scores on the importance of rodent control for pigs, human health and farm profit. We conclude that, although many pig producers have knowledge about risk sources for and consequences of T. gondii infections in pigs, the public health impact and risks of T. gondii infections in pigs are not yet common knowledge among all Dutch pig producers. Furthermore, Dutch pig producers differ in opportunity and motivation to control T. gondii infections. Targeted interventions to address these specific constraining behavioural factors can help to improve the control of T. gondii infections in pigs.","Behavioural factors of Dutch pig producers related to control of toxoplasma gondii infections in pigs.","Preventive veterinary medicine","van Wagenberg CPA and van Asseldonk MAPM and Bouwknegt M and Wisselink HJ","study with other mammals other than rat mice,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-24 19:26:09,-1,2021-03-03 16:32:06,,,,,,,,

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 62; 5 months old) were assigned to an ad libitum (Con) or weight-cycled (Cyc) group. They were either sedentary (Con-Sed and Cyc-Sed) or exercise-trained (Con-Ex and Cyc-Ex) on a motorized treadmill (20 m/minute; 60 minutes/day; 6 days/week). The Cyc groups underwent 2 cycles of 3 weeks of 60% food restriction followed by 5 weeks of ad libitum refeeding using a macronutrient self-selection diet. Body mass and food intake were analyzed weekly. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured at baseline and during the first and fifth weeks of each refeeding. RESULTS: For both cycling periods, SBP was elevated in Cyc vs. Con groups at Week 1 of refeeding, but was similar among groups by Week 5 of refeeding. Both Con groups had greater total energy intake than the Cyc groups for both cycling periods (Cycle 1: 2882.2 +/- 75.1, Con-Sed; 2916.1 +/- 67.1, Con-Ex; 2692.2 +/- 58.7, Cyc-Sed; and 2780.5 +/- 52.4 kcal, Cyc-Ex) (Cycle 2: 2815.8 +/- 75.1, Con-Sed; 2938.8 +/- 49.4, Con-Ex; 2577.1 +/- 60.5, Cyc-Sed; and 2643.5 +/- 65.9 kcal, Cyc-Ex). Relative fat intake (percentage of total kcal/week) was significantly less for Con-Ex and Cyc-Ex than Con-Sed and Cyc-Sed throughout both refeeding periods. DISCUSSION: Weight cycling failed to produce significant sustained effects on SBP, body mass, or food intake.

Initially all young rats exhibited regular or irregular estrous cycles and only about 41% of the older rats cycled regularly or irregularly; the remainder of the older rats did not cycle. During underfeeding, both the young and older rats lost body weight and ceased to cycle. After refeeding 100% of both young and old rats resumed cycling, the young rats for a much longer period than the old rats, and more of both groups continued to cycle than their ad lib-fed controls. Upon refeeding, the young and old rats reached the body weights of the ad lib-fed controls in about 3 weeks. Mammary tumors were initially present only in old rats and regressed during underfeeding; they rapidly reached control size upon refeeding. Plasma PRL levels declined during underfeeding but rebounded to higher than control values upon refeeding in both young and old rats. In young but not in old rats, plasma LH levels fell during underfeeding but returned to control values upon refeeding. These results demonstrate that a relatively short period of underfeeding, followed by refeeding, can delay the decline in reproductive cycles in young rats and reinitiate estrous cycles in older rats.

Similarly, the mechanisms that inhibit hunger and ingestive behavior might be most adaptive when these mechanisms cause individuals to stop foraging, hoarding and eating in order to find and court potential mates. In the laboratory, ingestive behaviors are typically studied separately from reproductive behaviors even though it is likely that these behaviors evolved under conditions in which both food and mates were available. We examined the choice between paracopulatory and ingestive behaviors in a semi-natural environment in which both food and potential mates were available. Intact female Syrian hamsters showed a high preference for males on days 3 and 4 (day 4 being the day of ovulation and estrous behavior), and a 48-h period of food deprivation significantly decreased preference for sex and increased preference for eating and food hoarding on day 3 in 89% of the hamsters, although none became anestrous. The same period of food deprivation significantly decreased the level of vaginal marking without significant effects on plasma estradiol concentrations. Next, hamsters were either food deprived (FD) or fed ad libitum, and half of each group was treated with vehicle or the adipocyte hormone leptin. The percentage of females with a low preference for sex was significantly greater in the FD compared to the ad libitum-fed groups, and leptin treatment prevented this effect. Metabolic fuels, possibly acting through leptin and other hormones, might influence sensitivity to estradiol or enhance the downstream effects of estradiol, thereby increasing motivation for sex and decreasing the relative motivation to forage, hoard and eat food.","Food deprivation and leptin prioritize ingestive and sex behavior without affecting estrous cycles in Syrian hamsters.","Hormones and behavior","Schneider JE and Casper JF and Barisich A and Schoengold C and Cherry S and Surico J and DeBarba A and Fabris F and Rabold E","study with other mammals other than rat mice,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-26 14:30:49,-1,2021-03-03 16:33:21,,,,,,,,

The current studies employed mice lacking NPY (Npy-/-) and their wild-type (Npy+/+) littermates to investigate the role of this peptide in the feeding response to circadian and palatability cues. To investigate the response to a circadian stimulus, we assessed food intake during the 4-h period following dark onset, a time of day characterized by maximal rates of food consumption. Compared to Npy+/+ controls, intake of Npy-/- mice was reduced by 33% during this period (0.6+/-0.1g versus 0.9+/-0.1g; p<or=0.05). In contrast, intake did not differ between genotypes when measured over a 24-h period (3.7+/-0.2g versus 3.5+/-0.3g; p=ns). Furthermore, reduced dark cycle 4h food intake in Npy-/- mice was not evident after a 24-h fast (1.4+/-0.1g for both genotypes; p=ns), despite a pronounced delay in the initiation of feeding (636+/-133 s versus 162+/-29 s; p<or=0.05). To investigate the role of NPY in the feeding response to palatability cues, mice were presented with a highly palatable diet (HP) for 1h each day (in addition to having ad libitum access to chow) for 18 days. Npy+/+ mice rapidly increased daily HP intake such that by the end of the first week, they derived a substantial fraction of daily energy from this source (41+/-3%). By comparison, HP intake was markedly reduced in Npy-/- mice during the first week (24+/-7% of daily energy intake, p<or=0.05 versus Npy+/+), although it eventually increased (by Day 9) to values comparable to those of Npy+/+ controls. These experiments suggest that NPY contributes to the mechanism whereby food intake increases in response to circadian and palatability cues and that mechanisms driving food intake in response to these stimuli differ from those activated by energy restriction.","Attenuated feeding responses to circadian and palatability cues in mice lacking neuropeptide Y.","Peptides","Sindelar DK and Palmiter RD and Woods SC and Schwartz MW","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc),no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 23:15:42,-1,2021-03-03 16:33:44,,,,,,,,

These data are consistent with the interpretation that immunohistochemically determined melatonin in unfixed pineal tissue is assessing binding of N-acetylated indolealkylamines to pineal cell components. In albino rats maintained on 12-hour light: 12-hour dark cycles, melatonin binding exhibits a diurnal rhythm with low levels of saturation (30%) early in the light and saturation by endogenous melatonin near the onset of darkness. An annual rhythm of melatonin binding was observed in albino rats with low levels during the summer and high levels during the winter. Other rats were maintained on 12-hour light:dark cycles and fed for 2 hours either early in the light period or early in the dark period. For both morning- and evening-fed animals, melatonin binding was high prior to feeding and dropped immediately after feeding.

The suppression of feeding induced by VP was primarily due to a delayed onset of the first meal after injection and was reversed by a V1-receptor antagonist (7 micrograms/kg b.wt., IP), by the Ca(++)-channel blocker verapamil (5 mg/kg b.wt., IP) and by the alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist phentolamine (500 micrograms/kg b.wt.), but not by dissection of the hepatic branch of the vagus. In further experiments VP inhibited gastric emptying. This effect was not reversed by phentolamine. VP had also an aversive effect, but this effect was weaker than that of LiCl and probably not involved in VP-induced hypophagia. The results suggest that VP reduces feeding through a V1-receptor-mediated activation of an alpha-adrenergic mechanism. The inhibition of gastric emptying or a possible stimulation of hepatic oxidative metabolism by VP seems to be not essential for VP's effect on feeding. The results are consistent with a role of VP in stress-induced anorexia in rats.","Mechanisms of vasopressin's anorectic effect.","Physiology & behavior","Langhans W and Delprete E and Scharrer E","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-27 21:11:44,-1,2021-03-12 01:01:32,,,,,,,,

This study reports the effects of feed restriction in the context of an FDA regulatory submission. METHODS: Adult female rats (n = 20/group; weighing approximately 200 g each) were provided rodent chow ad lib (control) or at 20, 15, 10, or 7.5 g/rat/day (g/day) during a 2-week pre-mating phase, throughout the mating phase, and up to gestation day (GD) 7. On GD 8, all animals were provided ad lib feed until necropsy on GD 14. Estrous cyclicity, mating, and fertility parameters were evaluated. RESULTS: Ad lib rats consumed approximately 20 and 28 g/day during the pre-mating and gestation phases, respectively. All measured fertility parameters in the 20 g/day group were similar to control values. In the 15 g/day group, body weight was reduced by 16% at 2 weeks, prolonged diestrus occurred, and fertility was compromised due to reductions in corpora lutea. Within 2 weeks, mean body weight in groups receiving < or = 10 g/day was reduced by > or = 29% compared to ad lib values, and overt changes in estrous cyclicity, mating, and fertility occurred. The 7.5 g/day group was not sustainable beyond the pre-mating phase. CONCLUSIONS: For this study type, feed intake at < or = 50% ad lib values (< or = 10 g/day) was inadequate due to the magnitude and rapidity of body weight effects. Estrous parameters appeared slightly more sensitive than functional measures, as body weight changes of approximately 16% appeared near the threshold of changing routinely calculated estrous cycle parameters and were later associated with reduced fertility. In general, body weight differences of 10-15% by themselves were not adverse to normal reproduction (20 g/day).","Effects of feed restriction on fertility in female rats.","Birth defects research.

The eating habits of many people are characterized by the cycling between overconsumption of energy-rich foods and dieting, the effects of which on the microbiota are currently unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared the fecal microbiota of rats either continuously fed chow or palatable cafeteria diet to a 'cycled' group switched between the two diets (chow for 4, cafeteria for 3 days/wk, n = 12/group) over 16 wk. Enriched bacterial metabolic pathways were predicted, and a range of metabolic parameters was correlated to microbial taxa and pathways. Cycled rats showed large excursions in food intake on each diet switch. When switched from chow to cafeteria, they overconsumed, and when switched back to chow they underconsumed relative to those maintained on the two diets. Metabolic parameters of cycled rats were intermediate between those of the other diet groups (p < 0.05). The microbiota of cycled rats was nearly indistinguishable from rats under constant cafeteria diet, and both groups were significantly different to the chow group. Correlation analyses identified microbial metabolic pathways associated with an obese phenotype.

We previously demonstrated that brown adipose tissue (BAT), body and brain temperatures and arterial pressure and heart rate increase in an integrated manner during behaviorally active phases. Studies show that eating is preceded by increases in body and brain temperature, but whether eating is integrated into the BRAC has not been investigated. In the present study of chronically instrumented, unrestrained Sprague-Dawley rats, peaks in BAT temperature occurred every 96 +/- 7 and 162 +/- 16 min (mean +/- SE, n=14 rats) in dark and light periods respectively, with no apparent underlying regularity. With food available ad libitum, eating was integrated into the BRAC in a temporally precise manner. Eating occurred only after an increase in BAT temperature, commencing 15 +/- 1 min (mean +/- SE) after the onset of an increase, with no difference between dark and light phases. There were either no or weak preprandial and postprandial relations between intermeal interval and amount eaten during a given meal. Remarkably, with no food available the rat still disturbed the empty food container 16 +/- 1 min (p>0.05 versus ad libitum food) after the onset of increases in BAT temperature, and not at other times. Rather than being triggered by changes in levels of body fuels or other meal-associated factors, in sedentary laboratory rats with ad libitum access to food eating commences as part of the ultradian BRAC, a manifestation of intrinsic brain activity.","Heating and eating: brown adipose tissue thermogenesis precedes food ingestion as part of the ultradian basic rest-activity cycle in rats.","Physiology & behavior","Blessing W and Mohammed M and Ootsuka Y","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 22:48:35,-1,2021-03-03 16:35:34,,,,,,,,

Palatable rats rapidly escalated their intake by four times. Naltrexone, when administered systemically and into the NAcc, reduced FR1 responding for food and motivation to eat under a progressive ratio in both Chow and Palatable rats; conversely, when administered into the mPFC, the effects were highly selective for binge eating rats. Furthermore, we found a twofold increase in POMC and a approximately 50% reduction in PDyn gene expression in the mPFC of Palatable rats, when compared to control rats; however, no changes were observed in the NAcc.

Owing to the uncertainty over the effects of chronic antidepressant treatments in mice, these experiments compared the regulation of neurogenesis, neurotrophin levels, and behavior produced by chronic antidepressant treatments between two inbred mouse strains, MRL/MpJ and C57BL/6J. The MRL/MpJ strain is associated with enhanced wound healing and tissue regeneration, whereas C57BL/6J mice are used commonly for behavioral studies. Proliferation and survival of hippocampal progenitor cells were measured using flow cytometry, a new platform that rapidly quantifies the incorporation of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU). Hippocampal cell proliferation was increased significantly after chronic administration of fluoxetine (FLX: 5, 10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.), b.i.d.) or desipramine (DMI: 5, 10 mg/kg, i.p., b.i.d.) for 21 days in MRL/MpJ mice, but not in C57BL/6J mice. Hippocampal progenitor cells born prior to chronic antidepressant treatments were not affected in either mouse strain. Protein levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in MRL/MpJ mice were elevated significantly in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala after chronic FLX treatment, but increased only in the frontal cortex by chronic DMI. In contrast, BDNF levels in C57BL/6J mice were decreased in the hippocampus and increased in the amygdala after chronic FLX, and were decreased in the brain stem after chronic DMI. Novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH) was used to examine a behavioral effect produced by chronic antidepressant treatment. MRL/MpJ mice, chronically administered FLX or DMI, had significantly shorter latencies to consume food when exposed to a novel environment than untreated mice, whereas there were no effects on the behavior of C57BL/6J mice. In conclusion, robust effects of chronic antidepressant treatments on hippocampal cell proliferation and BDNF levels paralleled the ability of these drugs to produce changes in NIH behavior in MRL/MpJ, while none of these effects were produced in C57BL/6J mice. The greater responsiveness of MRL/MpJ mice may be important for drug discovery, for genetic studies, and for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying the physiological and behavioral effects of chronic antidepressant treatments.","Enhanced sensitivity of the MRL/MpJ mouse to the neuroplastic and behavioral effects of chronic antidepressant treatments.","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Balu DT and Hodes GE and Anderson BT and Lucki I","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 19:19:30,-1,2021-03-03 16:37:56,,,,,,,,

For this purpose, we trained male rats to self-administer either a sugary, highly palatable diet ('Palatable' rats) or a chow diet ('Chow' rats) for 1 hour a day.

In the conditioned place preference task, Palatable rats spent significantly more time in the compartment that was previously paired with the palatable food, compared to Chow controls. Furthermore, in the second-order schedule of reinforcement task, Palatable rats exhibited active lever responding 4- to 6-fold higher than Chow control rats. Finally, in the cue-induced suppression of feeding test, although Chow control subjects reduced responding by 32% in the presence of the conditioned punishment, Palatable rats persevered in responding despite the aversive cue.

Given its central location within a dense network of reciprocally connected regions, it is reasonable to expect that basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons should produce a rich repertoire of dynamical responses to taste stimuli. Here, we examined single BLA neuron taste responses in awake rats and report the existence of two distinct subgroups of BLA taste neurons operating simultaneously during perceptual processing. One neuron type produced long, protracted responses with dynamics that were strikingly similar to those previously observed in gustatory cortex. These responses reflect cooperation between amygdala and cortex for the purposes of processing palatability. A second type of BLA taste neuron may be part of the system often described as being responsible for reward learning: these neurons produced very brief, short-latency responses to rewarding stimuli; when the rat participated in procuring the taste by pressing a lever in response to a tone, however, those phasic taste responses vanished, phasic responses to the tone appearing instead. Our data provide strong evidence that the neural handling of taste is actually a distributed set of processes and that BLA is a nexus of these multiple processes.

Drug addicts find drug cues motivationally attractive and binge eaters are attracted by food cues. But the level of incentive salience elicited by a cue re-encounter still varies across time and brain states. In an animal model, cues become attractive and 'wanted' in an 'autoshaping' paradigm, where different targets of incentive salience emerge for different individuals. Some individuals (sign-trackers) find a predictive discrete cue attractive while others find a reward contiguous goal cue more attractive (location where reward arrives: goal-trackers). Here we assessed whether central amygdala mu opioid receptor stimulation enhances the phasic incentive salience of the goal-cue for goal-trackers during moments of predictive cue presence (expressed in both approach and consummatory behaviors to goal cue), just as it enhances the attractiveness of the predictive cue target for sign-trackers. Using detailed video analysis we measured the approaches, nibbles, sniffs, and bites directed at their preferred target for both sign-trackers and goal-trackers. We report that DAMGO microinjections in central amygdala made goal-trackers, like sign-trackers, show phasic increases in appetitive nibbles and sniffs directed at the goal-cue expressed selectively whenever the predictive cue was present. This indicates enhancement of incentive salience attributed by both goal trackers and sign-trackers, but attributed in different directions: each to their own target cue. For both phenotypes, amygdala opioid stimulation makes the individual's prepotent cue into a stronger motivational magnet at phasic moments triggered by a CS that predicts the reward UCS.","Which cue to 'want'?

However, reward pursuit is not always proportional to the pleasure experienced, because reward processing involves distinct components, including the motivation to obtain a reward (i.e., wanting) and the hedonic pleasure during the reward consumption (i.e., liking). Research conducted on rodents demonstrates that stress might directly amplify the cue-triggered wanting, suggesting that under stress wanting can be independent from liking. Here, we aimed to test whether a similar mechanism exists in humans. We used analog of a Pavlovian-Instrumental Transfer test (PIT) with an olfactory reward to measure the cue triggered wanting for a reward but also the sensory hedonic liking felt during the consumption of the same reward. The analog of a PIT procedure, in which participants learned to associate a neutral image and an instrumental action with a chocolate odor, was combined with either a stress-inducing or stress-free behavioral procedure. Results showed that compared with participants in the stress-free condition, those in the stress condition mobilized more effort in instrumental action when the reward-associated cue was displayed, even though they did not report the reward as being more pleasurable. These findings suggest that, in humans, stress selectively increases cue-triggered wanting, independently of the hedonic properties of the reward. Such a mechanism supports the novel explanation proposed by animal research as to why stress often produces cue-triggered bursts of binge eating, relapses in drug addiction, or gambling.","Stress increases cue-triggered 'wanting' for sweet reward in humans.","Journal of experimental psychology.

Restricted feeding schedules (RFS) induce anticipatory activity and impose daily oscillations of c-Fos and clock proteins in brain structures. Daily access to a palatable treat (chocolate) also elicits anticipatory activity and induces c-Fos expression mainly in corticolimbic structures. Here the influence of daily access to food or chocolate was explored by the analysis of the oscillatory patterns of PER1 in hypothalamic and corticolimbic structures. Wistar rats were exposed to RFS or to daily access to chocolate for 3 weeks. Persistence of food or chocolate entrained rhythms was determined 8 days after cessation of the feeding protocols. RFS and chocolate induced a phase shift in PER1 rhythmicity in corticolimbic structures with peak values at zeitgeber time 12 and a higher amplitude in the chocolate group. Both RFS and chocolate groups showed an upregulation of PER1 in the SCN. Food and chocolate entrained rhythms persisted for 8 days in behavior and in PER1 expression in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, accumbens, prefrontal cortex and central amygdala. The present data demonstrate the existence of different oscillatory systems in the brain that can be activated by entrainment to metabolic stimuli or to reward and suggest the participation of PER1 in both entraining pathways.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of GSK1521498, a novel mu-opioid receptor antagonist, on food-seeking behavior and on binge-like eating of a highly preferred chocolate diet. Food seeking was measured in rats trained to respond for chocolate under a second-order schedule of reinforcement, in which prolonged periods of food-seeking behavior were maintained by contingent presentation of a reward-associated conditioned reinforcer. After reaching a stable baseline in both procedures, animals were treated with GSK1521498 (0.1, 1, and 3 mg/kg; IP) or naltrexone (NTX, 0.1, 1, and 3 mg/kg; SC). The binge eating model was characterized by four temporally contiguous phases: 1-h chow access, 2-h food deprivation, 10-min chow access, and 10-min access to either chocolate-flavoured food or standard chow. During training the rats developed binge-like hyperphagia of palatable food and anticipatory chow hypophagia (anticipatory negative contrast). Both compounds reduced binge-like palatable food hyperphagia. However, GSK1521498 reduced the impact of high hedonic value on ingestion more specifically than NTX, abolishing anticipatory chow hypophagia. GSK1521498 also dose-dependently reduced food seeking both before and after food ingestion, whereas NTX reduced food seeking only after food ingestion. Thus, while both drugs affected the hedonic value of the preferred food, GSK1521498 also directly decreased incentive motivation for chocolate. Selective mu-opioid receptor antagonism by GSK1521498 may have utility as a treatment for reducing maladaptive, palatability-driven eating behavior by reducing the motivational properties of stimuli that elicit the binge eating commonly associated with obesity.","Inhibition of opioid transmission at the mu-opioid receptor prevents both food seeking and binge-like eating.","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Giuliano C and Robbins TW and Nathan PJ and Bullmore ET and Everitt BJ","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc),drug, optogenetic or comoribities at the time of intermittent protocol,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 19:21:48,-1,2021-03-03 16:40:28,,,,,,,,

After three of these cycles, the food intake of rats exposed only to restriction (R), or only to stress (S), did not differ from controls.

The R + S effect was replicated in an older group of rats (Experiment 2). The hyperphagia was characteristically binge-like, it constituted a 40% selective increase in highly palatable (HP) food (P < .001) over a discrete period of time (within 24 h post-stress), and reflected feeding for reward (higher HP:chow ratio) over metabolic need as occurred after restriction (higher chow:HP ratio). Subsequent experiments revealed that binge eating did not occur if only chow was available (Experiment 3) or if restriction-refeeding (R-R) did not proximally precede stress (Experiment 4). Experiment 5 revealed that a history of R-R cycles followed by only one stress episode was sufficient to increase intake to 53% above controls as early as 2 h after stress (P < .001). This animal model of binge eating should facilitate investigations into the neurochemical changes induced by dieting and environmental stress to produce disordered eating and provide a preclinical tool to test preventive strategies and treatments more relevant to bulimia nervosa, multiple cases of binge eating disorder (BED) and binge-purge type anorexia nervosa.","A new animal model of binge eating: key synergistic role of past caloric restriction and stress.","Physiology & behavior","Hagan MM and Wauford PK and Chandler PC and Jarrett LA and Rybak RJ and Blackburn K","drug, optogenetic or comoribities at the time of intermittent protocol,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-20 20:24:11,-1,2021-03-03 16:41:40,,,,,,,,

This study evaluated the effects of a high-fat food olfactory cue (bacon) in stimulating nose-poke food-seeking behavior on first exposure (novel) and after a period of access for consumption (familiar) in lean and obese Zucker rats at either 4 or 12 months of age, and under ad-lib fed (unrestricted; U) or chronically food-restricted (70% of ad-lib; R) conditions. Baseline nose-poke levels were comparable amongst all groups. At 4 months of age, only ObU rats displayed increased behavioral activation to familiar food cues. Twelve-month-old Ob rats, regardless of diet, exhibited substantially greater food-seeking behavior when exposed to both the novel and familiar olfactory cues. A strong positive correlation between body weight and nose-poke entries for the familiar food cue was observed at both ages, while this correlation for the novel food cue was significant in 12-month-old rats only. Similarly, there were strong positive correlations between food intake and poke entries for the familiar food cue was observed at both ages, while this correlation for the novel food cue was significant in 12-month-old rats only. Although it is possible that differences in olfactory sensitivity contribute to these behavioral effects, our findings support the interactions between food intake, obesity, and food-seeking behavior and are consistent with leptin inhibiting the brain's reactivity to food cues and suggest that the enhanced sensitivity to the food cues with leptin deficiency is likely to contribute to overeating and weight gain.","Obese rats with deficient leptin signaling exhibit heightened sensitivity to olfactory food cues.","Synapse (New York, N.Y.)","Thanos PK and Robison LS and Robinson JK and Michaelides M and Wang GJ and Volkow ND","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 23:00:23,-1,2021-03-03 16:42:24,,,,,,,,

We conducted a foraging experiment in which rats chose among four different foods over a continuous two-week time period. Regarding when choices were made, we found bursts of rapidly occurring actions, separated by time-varying inactive periods, partially based on a circadian rhythm. Regarding what was chosen, we found sequential dynamics in affective choices characterized by two key features: (a) a highly biased choice distribution; and (b) preferential attachment, in which the animals were more likely to choose what they had previously chosen. To capture the temporal dynamics, we propose a dual-state model consisting of active and inactive states. We also introduce a satiation-attainment process for bursty activity, and a non-homogeneous Poisson process for longer inactivity between bursts. For the sequential dynamics, we propose a dual-control model consisting of goal-directed and habit systems, based on outcome valuation and choice history, respectively.

27630843,31419190,31419190,"","ABSTRACT Objectives: One factor contributing to the development of obesity is overeating palatable food. The palatability of food is driven by specific energy yielding combinations and flavor profiles that may contribute to its overconsumption. In rodents, restricted access to palatable food (PF) is a strong stimulus to trigger binge-type eating behavior (BTE), food anticipatory activity (FAA), effort behaviors and withdrawal symptoms. This is accompanied by plastic changes in corticolimbic areas associated with motivation and reward responses. Palatable food contains mainly a mixture of fat and sugar, thus, the contribution of each macronutrient for the behavioral and neuronal changes is unclear. Methods: In this study, Wistar rats were exposed to restricted access to 50% fat rich diet (FRD) or 50% sugar rich diet (SRD) in order to compare the intensity of BTE, FAA, effort behaviors and withdrawal responses. Results: In corticolimbic areas, c-Fos activation and DeltaFosB accumulation were evaluated. After an acute exposition, rats ate more SRD than FRD, but FDR stimulated higher c-Fos. After chronic administration, the FDR group exhibited higher levels of BTE and FAA; this was associated with higher c-Fos and accumulation of DeltaFosB in the corticolimbic system. Similar effects in the FRD group were observed after one week of withdrawal. Discussion: Present data indicate that the fat rich diet is a stronger stimulus than the sugar rich diet for the development of wanting behavior for reward and the underlying plastic changes in the corticolimbic system. The differential effects may be due to the differing caloric density of the diets.","Fat rather than sugar diet leads to binge-type eating, anticipation, effort behavior and activation of the corticolimbic system.","Nutritional neuroscience","Espitia-Bautista E and Escobar C","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,2021-03-18 20:01:19,1,2021-02-22 19:27:59,-1,2021-03-03 16:49:45,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of honey on reproductive system of male rat offspring exposed to prenatal restraint stress. Dams were divided into four groups (n = 10/group): control, honey, stress and honey + stress groups. Dams from honey and honey + stress groups received oral honey (1.2 g kg(-1) body weight) daily from day 1 of pregnancy, meanwhile dams from stress and honey + stress groups were subjected to restraint stress (three times per day) from day 11 of pregnancy until delivery. At 10 weeks old, each male rat offspring was mated with a regular oestrus cycle female. Male sexual behaviour and reproductive performance were evaluated. Then, male rats were euthanised for assessment on reproductive parameters. Honey supplementation during prenatal restraint stress significantly increased testis and epididymis weights as well as improved the percentages of abnormal spermatozoa and sperm motility in male rat offspring.

Binge eating was induced in female rats by three 8-day cycles of food restriction/refeeding, followed by acute stress. Two groups of rats were used: NR+NS rats normally fed and not stressed and R+S rats exposed to cycles of food restriction/refeeding and then stressed. R+S rats had higher intake of HPF than the NR+NS controls. The two A(2A)AR agonists were tested at doses of 0.1 and 0.05 mg/kg intraperitoneally; VT 7 did not modify locomotor activity at either dose, whereas CGS 21680 only slightly reduced it at the higher dose tested.

In Experiment 1, a response-independent brief tone (500-ms, 105-dB, broadband, noisy signal, ranging up to 16 kHz, with spectral peaks at 3 and 500 Hz) disrupted the performance on an FI 60-s schedule. Responding with the response-independent tone was more vigorous than in the absence of the tone. This effect was replicated in Experiment 2 using a within-subject design, but no such effect was noted when a light was employed as a disrupter. In Experiment 3, a 500-ms tone, but not a light, had a similar effect on rats' performance on FR schedules.

It was determined that at night the size of the first meal increased and the relative duration of the post-meal interval decreased as a function of previous fast duration.

Current evidence regarding the potentially damaging effects of these changes is conflicting. METHODS: Here, we assess the metabolic effects of weight cycling in a murine model, comprising three dietary switches to normal or high-fat diets at 6 week intervals; male C57BL/6 mice were fed either a control (C) or high-fat (F) diet for 6 weeks (n=140/group). C and F groups were then either maintained on their initial diet (CC and FF, respectively) or switched to a high-fat (CF) or control (FC) diet (n=35/group). For the final 6 week interval, CC and CF groups were returned to the control diet (CCC and CFC groups), while FC and FF groups were placed on a high-fat diet (FCF and FFF) (n=28/group). RESULTS: For the majority of metabolic outcomes changes aligned with dietary switches; however, assessment of neuropeptides and receptors involved in appetite regulation and reward signalling pathways reveal variable patterns of expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that multiple cycling events leads to a significant increase in internal fat deposition, even when compared with animals maintained on a high-fat diet (internal fat: FCF: 7.4+/-0.2 g vs FFF: 5.6+/-0.2 g; P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Increased internal adipose tissue is strongly linked to the development of metabolic syndrome associated conditions such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Although further work will be required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the neuronal control of energy homoeostasis, these studies provide a causative link between weight cycling and adverse health.","Metabolic dysfunction following weight cycling in male mice.","International journal of obesity (2005)","Schofield SE and Parkinson JR and Henley AB and Sahuri-Arisoylu M and Sanchez-Canon GJ and Bell JD","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",1,2021-03-18 20:02:19,1,2021-02-23 20:42:12,-1,2021-03-04 19:28:21,,,,,,,,

This has been interpreted as a rhythm controlled by food-entrainable circadian oscillators, because the rhythm persists during several cycles of total food deprivation and fails to track mealtimes if the feeding schedule deviates substantially from 24. These and other properties distinguish anticipation of daily meals from anticipation of food rewards provided at intervals in the seconds-to-minutes range, suggesting distinct mechanisms. It has been reported that rats can anticipate meals at long, but noncircadian, intervals if they are required to work for food, and that anticipation of daily meals, expressed in operant behavior, shows the scalar property, a hallmark of timing intervals in the seconds-to-minutes range. These observations raise the possibility of a universal timing system, rather than unique mechanisms for circadian and noncircadian intervals. To test whether circadian constraints on daily meal timing depend on the measure of behavior, we re-examined formal properties of food anticipation using lever pressing and motion sensors. We observed robust anticipation in both measures to meals at 24-hr intervals but no anticipation of meals at 18-hr intervals in light-dark or constant light and no evidence that the duration of anticipation scales with the interval between lighting transitions and mealtime. We are therefore unable to confirm reports that operant measures can reveal timing at long, but noncircadian, intervals. If timing processes exist that do permit anticipation of events at long, but noncircadian, intervals, the conditions under which these can be revealed are evidently highly constrained.","Circadian food anticipatory activity: Entrainment limits and scalar properties re-examined.","Behavioral neuroscience","Petersen CC and Patton DF and Parfyonov M and Mistlberger RE","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,2021-03-18 20:03:26,0,2021-02-24 18:38:53,-1,2021-03-04 19:29:30,,,,,,,,

In FF rats, hypothalamic apoE mRNA and protein levels fluctuated with peaks occuring during the dark phase and the nadirs occuring during the light phase. This pattern was altered in RF rats, which had a marked increase in hypothalamic apoE mRNA and protein levels during the 4-h feeding period in the light phase. Although corticosterone (CORT) levels temporally coincided with the increasing phase of apoE in the hypothalamus in both FF and RF rats, depletion of CORT by adrenalectomy (ADX) did not significantly influence the hypothalamic apoE levels during either period, implying that the circadian pattern of hypothalamic apoE is regulated by factors other than circulating CORT. The finding that hypothalamic apoE and food intake are positively associated during the normal circadian cycle as well as in the period of restricted feeding suggests that hypothalamic apoE is food-entrained and likely involved in the physiological regulation of daily food intake.","Food-entrained rhythmic expression of apolipoprotein E expression in the hypothalamus of rats.","Brain research","Shen L and Carey K and Wang DQ and Woods SC and Liu M","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc),no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-24 19:22:20,-1,2021-03-04 19:32:28,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The present work was conducted to determine if two drugs that interfere with cannabinoid receptor transmission, AM251 and AM4113, have effects on food-reinforced behavior after administration into the lateral ventricle (intracerebroventricular (ICV)). RESULTS: Although systemic administration of both drugs can suppress food-reinforced behavior, neither AM251 (40, 80, and 160 microg) nor AM4113 (60, 120, and 240 microg) administered at various times prior to testing produced any suppression of food-reinforced operant responding on a fixed-ratio 5 schedule. Because the modulation of locomotion by drugs that act on CB1 receptors is hypothesized to be a forebrain effect, these drugs also were assessed for their ability to reverse the locomotor suppression produced by the CB1 agonist AM411. ICV administration of either AM251 or AM4113 reversed the locomotor suppression induced by the CB1 agonist AM411 in the same dose range that failed to produce any effects on feeding. CONCLUSIONS: This indicates that both AM4113 and AM251, when administered ICV, can interact with forebrain CB1 receptors and are efficacious on forebrain-mediated functions unrelated to feeding.

By the second week 3D rats began to display a disordered eating pattern. After 28 days on this feeding schedule SVS was withdrawn and anxiety was measured in an elevated plus maze. Motivation was assessed through operant performance for 10% sucrose on a progressive ratio schedule and craving was examined with a reinstatement test for lever pressing following extinction. Initial measures of anxiety and motivation found no differences among groups. However, when food was deprived overnight, there was a greater increase in lever pressing in the 3D group compared to 7D and Naive rats. Thus a history of intermittent SVS access enhanced the reinforcing value of sucrose, but only under deprivation conditions.

None of the fat hamsters became anestrous until their body weights had declined to the level of lean hamsters.

GHSR also displays ligand-independent activity, including a high constitutive activity that signals in the absence of ghrelin and is reduced by LEAP2. GHSR activity modulates a variety of food intake-related behaviours, including binge eating. Previously, we reported that GHSR-deficient mice daily and time-limited exposed to a high-fat (HF) diet display an attenuated binge-like HF intake compared to wild-type mice. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether ligand-independent GHSR activity affects binge-like HF intake in a 4-day binge-like eating protocol. We found that plasma levels of ghrelin and LEAP2 were not modified in mice exposed to this binge-like eating protocol. Moreover, systemic administration of ghrelin or LEAP2 did not alter HF intake in our experimental conditions. Interestingly, we found that central administration of LEAP2 or K-(D-1-Nal)-FwLL-NH2 , which are both blockers of constitutive GHSR activity, reduced binge-like HF intake, whereas central administration of ghrelin or the ghrelin-evoked GHSR activity blockers [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 and JMV2959 did not modify binge-like HF intake.

Using an olfactometer, females fed partial blood meals were scored for host-seeking behavior within 1 h, and their blood meal sizes were measured chemically immediately afterwards. The suppression of host-seeking within 1 h after a blood meal appears to be caused by abdominal distention from ingested blood. Mosquitoes of either strain were attracted to a host when the blood meal size was less than 2.5 microliter; above this threshold there was a sharp decline in the tendency to respond. Small mosquitoes resulting from a low larval diet had a lower threshold, and were more likely to cease host-seeking after a small blood meal. Multiple feeding within a single gonotrophic cycle may result if mosquitoes take small blood meals which are insufficient to terminate host-seeking. Partial meals and reduced feeding success of mosquitoes can result from defensive host behavior, which in the laboratory rat was shown to increase at high mosquito densities.","Blood meal size as a factor affecting continued host-seeking by Aedes aegypti (L.).","The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","Klowden MJ and Lea AO","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-02-26 14:39:27,-1,2021-03-04 19:36:21,,,,,,,,

However, estrogens have also been shown to increase reward derived from drugs of abuse, where motivational properties of drugs and progression to addiction are potentiated by estrogens. Whether reward derived from food, and specifically motivational properties of food, are altered by estrogens remains unknown. Here we investigated the effect of the estrous cycle on food reward behavior and show estrous cycle dictated variability in food motivation, measured by progressive ratio operant conditioning, in female rats. Reward behavior was lowest on days associated with high estrogen signaling. We therefore also examined the actions of subcutaneously administered beta-estradiol on food reward and found that beta-estradiol reduced food reward behavior. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a crucial node of the neurocircuitry underlying motivated behavior and estrogen receptors are expressed in this nucleus. Thus, we examined whether the effects of estrogens on reward were exerted directly at the level of the VTA. Intra-VTA microinjection of beta-estradiol led to a significant reduction in food-motivated behavior. Interestingly, this effect was not accompanied by a reduction in chow intake or body weight, nor did it alter locomotor activity. Importantly, removal of the ovaries produced a potent and lasting elevation in food reward and food-seeking behavior, suggesting that ovarian sex steroids are critical for maintenance of normal food reward behavior.

The present study is aimed to determine the age-associated alteration in the activity and expression of arginase II in the kidney of mice of different ages. The effect of dietary restriction to modulate the agedependent changes of arginase II was also studied. Results showed that renal arginase II activity declines significantly with the progression of age (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.001 in 6- and 18-month-old mice, respectively as compared to 2-month old mice) and is due to the reduction in its protein as well as the mRNA level (p less than 0.001 in both 6- and 18-month-old mice as compared to 2-month-old mice).

One of the major features of the models centered on whether the two types of behavior are inevitably related. The general design of the present experiment involved testing for muricide either (a) after deprivation of food and/or water or (b) at times during the normal diurnal cycle when the two consummatory responses were at their minima and maxima. Deprivation and testing for muricide were limited to a single episode in order to eliminate confounding effects of repeated deprivations and of repeated exposures to prey. Periods of acute deprivation ranging from 5.5 to 22.0 hr did not induce significant quantitative changes in muricidal behavior. However, muricide and the appetitive behaviors did co-vary under conditions associated with the normal diurnal cycle. Comparing the present results with findings from experiments using repeated deprivation leads to the suggestion that covariation of appetitive and muricidal behaviors is not an innate characteristic, but rather is acquired through processes of learning.

In Experiment 1 we tested rats on memory tasks reliant on the hippocampus (place recognition), perirhinal cortex (object recognition), and a combination of hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and perirhinal cortex (object-in-place memory). Exposure to sucrose for 2h a day for 14days prior to behavioral testing did not affect object recognition, but impaired spatial memory to an extent in both male and female rats. Male rats exposed to sucrose were impaired at both place recognition and object-in-place recognition, however female rats showed no impairment in object-in-place performance. Plasticity within the hippocampus is known to increase during the proestrus phase of the estrous cycle and is related to higher levels of circulating estrogens.

Both sucrose exposed and control female rats were able to perform place object-in-place recognition correctly during metestrus and proestrus, however sucrose exposed rats were only able to perform place recognition correctly during proestrus.

In addition, the CS-excited LS neurons showed a decrease in responsiveness to sucrose during the development of sucrose overeating.

We further investigated the olfactory function in a rodent model relevant to the situation encountered in obese humans, where genetic susceptibility is juxtaposed on chronic eating disorders. Using several olfactory-driven tests, we compared the behaviors of obesity-prone Sprague-Dawley rats (OP) fed with a high-fat/high-sugar diet with those of obese-resistant ones fed with normal chow. In OP rats, we reported 1) decreased odor threshold, but 2) poor olfactory performances, associated with learning/memory deficits, 3) decreased influence of fasting, and 4) impaired insulin control on food seeking behavior. Associated with these behavioral modifications, we found a modulation of metabolism-related factors implicated in 1) electrical olfactory signal regulation (insulin receptor), 2) cellular dynamics (glucorticoids receptors, pro- and antiapoptotic factors), and 3) homeostasis of the olfactory mucosa and bulb (monocarboxylate and glucose transporters). Such impairments might participate to the perturbed daily food intake pattern that we observed in obese animals.","Long-Lasting Metabolic Imbalance Related to Obesity Alters Olfactory Tissue Homeostasis and Impairs Olfactory-Driven Behaviors.","Chemical senses","Lacroix MC and Caillol M and Durieux D and Monnerie R and Grebert D and Pellerin L and Repond C and Tolle V and Zizzari P and Baly C","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc),no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 14:41:40,-1,2021-03-04 19:44:00,,,,,,,,

SD rats were fed Purina Certified Rodent Diet AL (group 1), DR at 72-79% of AL (group 2), DR at 68-72% of AL (group 3) or DR at 47-48% of AL (group 4) for 106 weeks. Interim necropsies were performed at 13, 26, and 53 weeks, after a 7-day 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-filled minipump implantation. Body weights, organ weights, carcass analysis, in-life data including estrous cyclicity, and histopathology were determined. At 6-7 weeks of age SD rats had 6% body fat. AL-feeding resulted in hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and dietary-induced obesity (DIO) by study week 14, with 25% body fat that progressed to 36-42% body fat by 106 weeks. As early as 14 weeks, key biomarkers developed for spontaneous nephropathy, cardiomyopathy, and degenerative changes in multiple organ systems. Early endocrine disruption was indicated by changes in metabolic and endocrine profiles and the early development and progression of lesions in the pituitary, pancreatic islets, adrenals, thyroids, parathyroids, liver, kidneys, and other tissues. Reproductive senescence was seen by 9 months with declines in estrous cyclicity and pathological changes in the reproductive organs of both sexes fed AL or moderate DR, but not marked DR. The diabesity syndrome in AL-fed, DIO SD rats was readily modulated or prevented by moderate to marked DR. Moderate DR of balanced diets resulted in a better toxicology model by significantly improving survival, controlling adult body weight and obesity, reducing the onset, severity, and morbidity of age-related renal, endocrine, metabolic, and cardiac diseases. Moderate DR feeding reduces study-to-study variability, increases treatment exposure time, and increases the ability to distinguish true treatment effects from spontaneous aging. The structural and metabolic differences between the phenotypes of DIO and DR SD rats indicated changes of polygenic expression over time in this outbred stock. AL-overfeeding of SD rats produces a needed model of DIO and diabesity that needs further study of its patterns of polygenic expression and phenotype.","Diabesity: a polygenic model of dietary-induced obesity from ad libitum overfeeding of Sprague-Dawley rats and its modulation by moderate and marked dietary restriction.","Toxicologic pathology","Keenan KP and Hoe CM and Mixson L and McCoy CL and Coleman JB and Mattson BA and Ballam GA and Gumprecht LA and Soper KA","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc),no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 14:06:24,-1,2021-03-04 19:44:16,,,,,,,,

Chlordecone accelerated vaginal estrus, but sexual behavior was eliminated, delayed, or reduced. Chlordecone treatment led to the presence of vaginal estrus within 2 days, but reduced or eliminated sexual behavior on the evening of predicted proestrus. Of the females that received chlordecone, 20% to 50% showed some behavior on the day after the evening of predicted proestrus and 20% to 35% never showed behavior during the 8-day observation period. Although the lordosis to mount ratio was still reduced, the occurrence of behavior a day late suggested that the pesticide had delayed behavioral estrus. Chlordecone also rapidly suppressed food intake and led to a significant decline in body weight; these nutritional factors could have contributed to the disrupted estrous cycle. Some support for this possibility was derived from a reduced sexual receptivity on the evening of proestrus when the caloric intake of untreated female rats was matched to that of the chlordecone treated animals. However, the effects of caloric reduction on proestrous lordosis behavior were less robust than seen following chlordecone. Chlordecone treatment on diestrus 2 reduced the number of progesterone receptors in uterine tissue of females on the predicted day of proestrus. This suggested that the tissue sensitivity to circulating levels of progesterone would be reduced within 2 days after chlordecone treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Vaginal cyclicity, sexual receptivity, and eating behavior of the female rat following treatment with chlordecone.","Reproductive toxicology (Elmsford, N.Y.)","Williams J and Uphouse L","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 22:44:40,-1,2021-03-04 19:44:53,,,,,,,,

Despite advances in determining the role of the CB1 receptor in obesity, its involvement in the driven nature of eating pathologies has received little attention. The present study examined CB1 receptor alterations as a consequence of dietary-induced binge eating in female Sprague Dawley rats. Four control groups were used to control for calorie restriction and highly palatable food variables characterizing this behavioral model. All groups were kept on their respective feeding schedules for 6-weeks and were given a uniform 33% calorie restriction (~22 h food deprivation) prior to sacrifice. Our findings indicate that regional CB1 mRNA and density were influenced by dietary conditions, but were not specific to the dietary-induced binge eating paradigm used. An increase of approximately 50% (compared with naive controls) in CB1 receptor mRNA levels in the nucleus of the solitary tract as measured by in situ hybridization was found in animals receiving continuous access to a highly palatable food (i.e., vegetable shortening with 10% sucrose). This group also had a significant increase in body weight and adiposity. An approximate 20% reduction in CB1 mRNA was observed in the cingulate cortex (areas 1 and 2) in animals exposed to an intermittent schedule of feeding, compared with groups that had ad libitum feeding schedules (i.e., continuous access and naive controls). Receptor density as measured by [(3)H]CP55,940 autoradiography, was reduced by approximately 30% in the nucleus accumbens shell region in groups receiving repeated access to the highly palatable food.

Previous research has shown that perinatal consumption of highly palatable foods by the mother can influence the development of offspring taste preferences and alter gene expression within the central nervous system (CNS) reward system. Opioids stimulate consumption of both fats and carbohydrates, and overconsumption of these energy dense foods increases the risk for obesity. What has remained unclear is whether this risk can be transmitted to the offspring before gestation or if it is wholly the gestational exposure that affects offspring brain development. Utilizing an embryo transfer experimental design, 2-cell embryos were obtained from obese or control dams, and transferred to obese or control gestational carriers. Expression of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR), preproenkephalin (PENK), and the dopamine transporter was evaluated in the hypothalamus and reward circuitry (ventral tegmental area, prefrontal cortex, and nucleus accumbens) in adult and late embryonic brains. Obesity before pregnancy altered expression levels of both MOR and PENK, with males relatively more affected than females.

However, it is not clear whether the activity of dopamine neurons is related or not to vigilance states. Using unit recordings in unanesthetized head restrained rats we measured the firing pattern of dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area across the sleep-wake cycle. We found these cells were activated during paradoxical sleep (PS) via a clear switch to a prominent bursting pattern, which is known to induce large synaptic dopamine release. This activation during PS was similar to the activity measured during the consumption of palatable food. Thus, as it does during waking in response to novelty and reward, dopamine could modulate brain plasticity and thus participate in memory consolidation during PS. By challenging the traditional view that dopamine is the only aminergic group not involved in sleep physiology, this study provides an alternative perspective that may be crucial for understanding the physiological function of PS and dream mentation.","Prominent burst firing of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area during paradoxical sleep.","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Dahan L and Astier B and Vautrelle N and Urbain N and Kocsis B and Chouvet G","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-15 15:37:29,-1,2021-01-29 22:25:12,,,,,,,,

The results of a second experiment suggested that the rate difference might reduce or disappear with extended exposure to the schedule. The third experiment exposed rats to fixed-interval 60-sec and mixed fixed-interval 10-sec fixed-interval 110 sec schedules. Response rate differences between the PU and control groups occurred only under the mixed schedule, a result interpreted as showing that temporal irregularity of reward delivery plays some role in the genesis of more rapid operant responding in PU rats. When rats received a larger variable-ratio schedule, requiring 40 responses for reward, no significant rate differences between the groups were found over the whole experimental condition.

Postdeprivational food intake in male rats and mice was also reduced by naloxone in a dose-dependent fashion. This naloxone effect was less pronounced than actions observed with water intake, and tended to diminish with lengthening food deprivation periods. In general, mice appeared to be less sensitive than rats to naloxone suppression of food and water intake. Naloxone appears to markedly reduce appetitive behavior, particularly water intake, following deprivation in both rats and mice.

Gustatory information can also reach another frontal region, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), via direct projections from GC. mPFC has been studied extensively in relation to its role in controlling goal-directed action and reward-guided behaviors, yet very little is known about its involvement in taste coding. The experiments presented here address this important point and test whether neurons in mPFC can significantly process the physiochemical and hedonic dimensions of taste. Spiking responses to intraorally delivered tastants were recorded from rats implanted with bundles of electrodes in mPFC and GC. Analysis of single-neuron and ensemble activity revealed similarities and differences between the two areas. Neurons in mPFC can encode the chemosensory identity of gustatory stimuli. However, responses in mPFC are sparser, more narrowly tuned, and have a later onset than in GC. Although taste quality is more robustly represented in GC, taste palatability is coded equally well in the two areas. Additional analysis of responses in neurons processing the hedonic value of taste revealed differences between the two areas in temporal dynamics and sensitivities to palatability. These results add mPFC to the network of areas involved in processing gustatory stimuli and demonstrate significant differences in taste-coding between GC and mPFC.","Processing of hedonic and chemosensory features of taste in medial prefrontal and insular networks.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Jezzini A and Mazzucato L and La Camera G and Fontanini A","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-27 22:01:21,-1,2021-03-12 20:40:58,,,,,,,,

Specific removal of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) in midbrain LepR neurons (KO mice) disrupted DA accumulation in vesicles, but failed to cause a significant change in the evoked release of either glutamate or GABA to downstream neurons. While KO mice showed no differences on chow, they presented a reduced high-fat diet (HFD) intake and resisted to HFD-induced obesity. Specific activation of midbrain LepR neurons promoted VMAT2-dependent feeding on chow and HFD. When tested with an intermittent access to HFD where first 2.5-h HFD eating (binge-like) and 24-h HFD feeding were measured, KO mice exhibited more binge-like, but less 24-h HFD feeding.

Significant reductions in binge size were observed with stimulation of either target but with significant variation in effectiveness across individuals. When features of local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the NAc were used to classify the pre-defined stimulation outcomes (response or non-response) from each rat using a machine-learning approach (lasso), stimulation outcomes could be classified with greater accuracy than expected by chance (effect sizes: core = 1.13, shell = 1.05). Further, these LFP features could be used to identify the best stimulation target for each animal (core vs. shell) with an effect size = 0.96. These data suggest that individual differences in underlying network activity may relate to the variable outcomes of circuit based interventions, and measures of network activity could have the potential to individually guide the selection of an optimal stimulation target to improve overall treatment response rates.","Machine Learning Based Classification of Deep Brain Stimulation Outcomes in a Rat Model of Binge Eating Using Ventral Striatal Oscillations.","Frontiers in psychiatry","Doucette WT and Dwiel L and Boyce JE and Simon AA and Khokhar JY and Green AI","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc)",-1,,-1,2021-02-18 19:09:51,-1,2021-02-18 00:34:49,,,,,,,,

In Experiment 1, sucrose solutions were first provided continuously or every second, third, or fourth day for 23.5h over 49days. Continuous-access sucrose consumption averaged 102g per day, while that for access every fourth day averaged 294g. Daily consumption averages for access every second and third day fell between these two extremes.

Body weight was unaffected by sucrose access; rats adjusted their food consumption so that total calorie intake remained constant. In Experiment 2, compared to continuous 4% sucrose solution access, access every third day markedly elevated daily sucrose consumption after only four sucrose exposures. With this shorter Phase I, sucrose intake in the continuous group increased markedly when in Phase II all rats were given alternate day access. In Experiment 3, a lick-by-lick analysis of the difference in sucrose consumption between access every third day and continuous access revealed that all rats were consuming a similar number of sucrose meals; however, the meals were larger both in the first hour and over the whole 24h with intermittent access.

However, how motivational responses to food cues are affected by the estrous cycle or ovarian hormones is unknown. In addition, while individual susceptibility to obesity is accompanied by enhanced incentive motivational responses to food cues and increased NAc intrinsic excitability in males, studies in females are absent. Therefore, we examined basal differences in intrinsic NAc excitability of obesity-prone vs. obesity-resistant females and determined how conditioned approach (a measure of cue-triggered motivation), food intake, and motivation for food vary with the cycle in naturally cycling female obesity-prone, obesity-resistant, and outbred Sprague-Dawley rats. Finally, we used ovariectomy followed by hormone treatment to determine the role of ovarian hormones in cue-triggered motivation in selectively-bred and outbred female rats. We found that intrinsic excitability of NAc MSNs and conditioned approach are enhanced in female obesity-prone vs. obesity-resistant rats. These effects were driven by greater MSN excitability and conditioned approach behavior during metestrus/diestrus vs. proestrus/estrus in obesity-prone but not obesity-resistant rats, despite similar regulation of food intake and food motivation by the cycle in these groups. Furthermore, estradiol and progesterone treatment reduced conditioned approach behavior in obesity-prone and outbred Sprague-Dawley females.

The homeostatic regulation of food intake is critically dependent on top-down control of reward-driven food craving. There is accumulating evidence from animal studies that the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) is involved in regulating hunger states and eating behavior, but whether OXT also contributes to cognitive control of food craving in humans is still unclear. We conducted a counter-balanced, double-blind, within-subject, pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging experiment involving 31 healthy women who received 24 IU of intranasal OXT or placebo and were scanned twice while they were exposed to pictures of palatable food. The participants were instructed either to imagine the immediate consumption or to cognitively control the urge to eat the food. Our results show a trend that OXT specifically reduced food craving in the cognitive control condition. On the neural level, these findings were paralleled by an increase of activity in the middle and superior frontal gyrus, precuneus, and cingulate cortex under OXT. Interestingly, the behavioral OXT effect correlated with the OXT-induced changes in the prefrontal cortex and precuneus. Collectively, the present study provides first evidence that OXT plays a key role in the cognitive regulation of food craving in women by strengthening activity in a broad neurocircuitry implicated in top-down control and self-referential processing.

Previously, we found that when wild-type mice and hypocretin/ataxin-3 littermates (which are depleted of hypothalamic hypocretin-expressing neurons postnatally) were administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the two genotypes exhibited significant differences in their sleep/wake cycle, including differences in the degree of increase in sleep periods and in recovery from sickness behaviour. In the present study, we examined changes in the hypothalamic vigilance system and in the hypothalamic expression of inflammatory factors in response to LPS in hypocretin/ataxin-3 mice. Peripheral immune challenge with LPS affected the hypothalamic immune response and vigilance states. This response was altered by the loss of hypocretin. Hypocretin expression was inhibited after LPS injection in both hypocretin/ataxin-3 mice and their wild-type littermates, but expression was completely abolished only in hypocretin/ataxin-3 mice. Increases in the number of histidine decarboxylase (HDC)-positive cells and in Hdc mRNA expression were found in hypocretin/ataxin-3 mice, and this increase was suppressed by LPS. Hypocretin loss did not impact the change in expression of hypothalamic inflammatory factors in response to LPS, except for interferon gamma and colony stimulating factor 3. The number of c-Fos-positive/HDC-positive cells in hypocretin/ataxin-3 mice administered LPS injections was elevated, even during the rest period, in all areas, suggesting that there is an increase in the activity of histaminergic neurons in hypocretin/ataxin-3 mice following LPS injection.

In the first experiment, rats performed lever press responses for food pellets in an ascending series of ratios or fixed unit prices (FUP) when food was available for four 40-min food opportunities (FO) per day. Daily intake at low FUP was comparable to ad libitum intakes. Intake declined as FUP increased and was not distributed equally among the four FOs. In particular, the last FO of a session (occurring at about lights on in a 12:12cycle) was the smallest, even when total intake was low due to the response requirement at high FUP. Within FOs, satiation was evident at low FUPs by a decrease in rate of intake across a 40min FO; at high FUPs responding was evenly distributed. In the second experiment, rats had a choice of responding on two levers for either intermittent inexpensive (II; low FUP according to a four FO schedule) or costly continuous (CC; 20-fold higher FUP but available throughout 23-h sessions) food. Most (73%) of the rats consistently chose almost all of their food from the II source. Further, as the timing of the four II FOs were changed relative to the light: dark Zeitgeber, the time of the smallest meal changed such that the smallest meal (s) were during the light period regardless of ordinal position within a session.

By using stereology and expression of cell cycle markers, we found that the placenta grows under normal conditions not just by hyperplasia of trophoblast cells but also through extensive polyploidy and cell hypertrophy. In response to feeding a low protein diet to mothers prior to and during pregnancy, to mimic chronic malnutrition, we found that this normal program was altered and that it was influenced by the sex of the conceptus. Male fetuses showed intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) by embryonic day (E) 18.5, just before term, whereas female fetuses showed IUGR as early as E16.5. This difference was correlated with differences in the size of the labyrinth layer of the placenta, the site of nutrient and gas exchange. Functional changes were implied based on up-regulation of nutrient transporter genes. The junctional zone was also affected, with a reduction in both glycogen trophoblast and spongiotrophoblast cells. These changes were associated with increased expression of Phlda2 and reduced expression of Egfr. Polyploidy, which results from endoreduplication, is a normal feature of trophoblast giant cells (TGC) but also spongiotrophoblast cells. Ploidy was increased in sinusoidal-TGCs and spongiotrophoblast cells, but not parietal-TGCs, in low protein placentas.

However, saccharin does not trigger a fixed rate of lapping at any point in the sequence. When rats have only intermittent access to saccharin early in the session, they increase their rates of lapping so that, within each few minutes, the amount of lapping (or some correlate such as volume drunk) is held constant. This happens over a wide range of restriction conditions. And if compensation cannot occur during a period of constraint, then it occurs afterward, promptly and precisely. When constraint is withdrawn, rats drink amounts such that the total amount of drinking (or its correlate), through that point in the ingestive bout, is defended. These findings imply that the controlling system includes (1) an integrator that keeps track of the amount of drinking that has occurred, even across interruptions; and (2) a short-term feedback loop that operates minute by minute within the bout. This loop regulates, not the rate of lapping to be emitted, but the amount of lapping to be done (or its correlate); Thus the decline in responsiveness to saccharin as drinking progresses reflects a depression of this regulated value, not of lap rate per se.","Some determinants of the time course of saccharin ingestion in hungry rats.","Appetite","Mook DG and Wagner S","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,2021-03-18 21:09:43,0,2021-02-22 22:54:57,-1,2021-03-05 22:33:31,,,,,,,,

Foods consumed during a binge are also often high in fat and/or sugar. Ghrelin, signaling centrally via the growth-hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), stimulates growth hormone release and appetite. GHSR signaling also enhances the rewarding value of palatable foods and increases the motivation for such foods. As ghrelin interacts directly with dopaminergic reward circuitry, shown to be involved in binge eating, the current studies explored the role of GHSR signaling in a limited access model of binge eating in mice. In this model, mice received either intermittent (INT) or daily (DAILY) access to a nutritionally complete high-fat diet (HFD) for 2h late in the light cycle, alongside 24-h ad libitum chow. In CD-1 mice, 2-h exposure to HFD generated substantial binge-like intake of HFD, as well as a binge-compensate pattern of 24-h daily intake. INT and daily groups did not differ in 2-h HFD consumption, while INT mice maintained stable intake of chow despite access to HFD. GHSR knock-out (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice both binged during HFD access, and exhibited the same binge-compensate pattern. INT GHSR KO mice did not binge as much as WT, while DAILY KO and WT were comparable. Overall, GHSR KO mice consumed fewer calories from HFD, regardless of access condition. GHSR KO mice also had reduced activation of the nucleus accumbens shell, but not core, following HFD consumption. These data support the ability of INT HFD in mice to induce a binge-compensate pattern of intake that emulates select components of binge eating in humans. There also appears to be a role for GHSR signaling in driving HFD consumption under these conditions, potentially via mediation of reward-related circuitry.","Investigation of a role for ghrelin signaling in binge-like feeding in mice under limited access to high-fat diet.","Neuroscience","King SJ and Rodrigues T and Watts A and Murray E and Wilson A and Abizaid A","",1,,1,2021-02-16 17:59:31,1,2021-02-17 00:33:30,,,,,,,,

The molecular mechanisms underlying weight gain following cycles of dietary deprivation and refeeding are still poorly understood. One of the possibilities is that repeated loss and gain of weight may promote fat deposition in adipose tissue. To test this hypothesis we investigated serum leptin levels and lipogenic enzyme activities in white adipose tissue (WAT) of male Wistar rats during 12 days of ad libitum feeding following multiple cycles of alternating food deprivation and refeeding. Rats subjected to eight cycles of food deprivation and refeeding (MFR group) showed significantly decreased circulating leptin levels when compared with control rats (nearly 50% decrease in leptin levels, P < 0.01). Throughout 12 days of ad libitum feeding, serum leptin levels increased modestly but remained significantly (24%, P < 0.05) lower than control levels. Fatty acid synthase (FAS) and malic enzyme (ME) activities (chosen as representatives of enzymes directly involved in fatty acid synthesis) were found to be considerably higher in WAT of MFR rats refed for 3 days in comparison to control rats, and remained elevated even after 12 days of refeeding. These observations suggest that the elevation of lipogenic enzyme activities induced by multiple cycles of dietary deprivation followed by refeeding persists for several days, markedly increasing the lipogenic capacity of adipose tissue, which, accompanied by a decrease in circulating leptin levels, may promote weight gain.","The effects of weight cycling on serum leptin levels and lipogenic enzyme activities in adipose tissue.","Journal of physiology and pharmacology : an official journal of the Polish Physiological Society","Kochan Z and Karbowska J and Swierczynski J","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc),no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 23:07:16,-1,2021-03-05 22:33:55,,,,,,,,

In mammals, light is detected by (1) rods and cones, which mediate visual function, and (2) intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which primarily project to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus to regulate circadian rhythms. Recent evidence, however, demonstrates that ipRGCs also project to limbic brain regions, suggesting that, through this pathway, light may have a role in cognition and mood. Therefore, it follows that unnatural exposure to light may have negative consequences for mood or behavior. Modern environmental lighting conditions have led to excessive exposure to light at night (LAN), and particularly to blue wavelength lights. We hypothesized that nocturnal light exposure (i.e., dim LAN) would induce depressive responses and alter neuronal structure in hamsters (Phodopus sungorus). If this effect is mediated by ipRGCs, which have reduced sensitivity to red wavelength light, then we predicted that red LAN would have limited effects on brain and behavior compared with shorter wavelengths. Additionally, red LAN would not induce c-Fos activation in the SCN. Our results demonstrate that exposure to LAN influences behavior and neuronal plasticity and that this effect is likely mediated by ipRGCs. Modern sources of LAN that contain blue wavelengths may be particularly disruptive to the circadian system, potentially contributing to altered mood regulation.","Nocturnal light exposure impairs affective responses in a wavelength-dependent manner.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Bedrosian TA and Vaughn CA and Galan A and Daye G and Weil ZM and Nelson RJ","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-27 21:05:57,-1,2021-03-12 00:56:58,,,,,,,,

In vitro experiments in single-cells and brain slices and in vivo experiments in anesthetized rodents have been used to identify mechanisms that mediate dopamine release and uptake under normal conditions and in disease models. Over the last 20 years, in vivo FSCV experiments in awake, freely moving rodents have also provided insight of dopaminergic mechanisms in reward processing and reward learning. One major advantage of the awake, freely moving preparation is the ability to examine rapid DA fluctuations that are time-locked to specific behavioral events or to reward or cue presentation. However, one limitation of combined behavior and voltammetry experiments is the difficulty of dissociating DA effects that are specific to primary rewarding or aversive stimuli from co-occurring DA fluctuations that mediate reward-directed or other motor behaviors.

Subgroup analyses were conducted to differentiate compulsive-like 'high responder' intermittent access rats that escalated to extreme progressive-ratio self-administration performance vs. more resistant 'low responders.' Female rats had greater reinforcing efficacy of food than males in all diet conditions and were more often classified as 'high responders'.

We investigated the effect of a history of caloric restriction (HCR) in rats that involved cyclic food restriction and refeeding with varying levels of access to palatable food (PF) on: 1) responses to the SSRI, fluoxetine; 2) monoamine levels in brain regions central to the control of feeding, reward, and mood regulation; and 3) behavioral tests of anxiety and depression. HCR coupled with intermittent but not daily access to PF exaggerated rats' anorectic response to fluoxetine (p<0.05); was associated with a significant 71% and 58% reduction of 5-HT and dopamine, respectively, in the medial prefrontal cortex; and induced behaviors consistent with models of depression. HCR, irrespective of access to PF, abolished the strong association between 5-HT and dopamine turnover in the nucleus accumbens in control rats (r=0.71 vs. -0.06, p<0.01). Access to PF, irrespective of HCR, reduced hypothalamic dopamine. Together, these findings suggest that a history of frequent food restriction-induced weight fluctuation imposes neurochemical changes that negatively impact feeding and mood regulation.","A history of caloric restriction induces neurochemical and behavioral changes in rats consistent with models of depression.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior","Chandler-Laney PC and Castaneda E and Pritchett CE and Smith ML and Giddings M and Artiga AI and Boggiano MM","",1,,1,2021-02-22 19:16:53,1,2021-03-05 22:40:34,,,,,,,,

Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were grouped according to two schedules of access (Daily [D] or Intermittent [I]) to an optional FSM. Each FSM was created by whipping 3.2% (L), 10% (M), or 32% (H) powdered sugar into 100% vegetable shortening in a w/w manner (n=10 per group). One-hour intakes of the IL and IM groups were significantly greater than intakes of the respective DL and DM groups, thus fulfilling our operational definition of binge-type eating in these groups. Baclofen reduced intakes of the L and M mixtures regardless of access schedule, but failed to reduce intake of the H mixture. Naltrexone reduced intake in all groups, but potency was greater in IL rats than in DL rats. Furthermore, potency was attenuated in Intermittent rats, but enhanced in Daily rats, at higher sucrose concentrations. Raclopride reduced intake in the DL and stimulated intake in the IL groups, reduced intake in both M groups, and was without effect in both H groups. These results indicate that fat/sucrose mixtures containing relatively low concentrations of sucrose allow distinctions to be made between: 1) intakes stimulated by different access schedules and 2) opioid and dopaminergic modulation of those intakes. These results also suggest that brief bouts of food consumption involving fatty, sugar-rich foods may prove to be particularly resistant to pharmacological intervention.","Baclofen, raclopride, and naltrexone differentially affect intake of fat/sucrose mixtures under limited access conditions.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior","Wong KJ and Wojnicki FH and Corwin RL","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc)",1,2021-03-18 21:10:45,-1,2021-02-20 20:25:41,1,2021-03-05 22:42:08,,,,,,,,

Although it is well known that Pavlovian contingencies will generate conditioned behavior that is temporally organized with respect to the arrival of the predicted outcome, little work has examined the temporal dynamics of responding during Pavlovian-instrumental transfer. We trained rats using a fixed time 60-sec, fixed time 120-sec, or random time 60-sec schedule in an appetitive Pavlovian task, and found that presentation of the conditioned stimulus potentiated operant responding in a manner that reflected these previously established temporal expectancies. Further, this temporal specificity conformed to the scalar property as seen with other forms of interval timing behavior. Surprisingly, this effect was only seen when the conditioned stimulus was a visual cue, but not when it was an auditory cue.

Clinical studies suggest that individuals with BED may have impairments in cognitive processes, executive functioning, impulse control, and decision-making, which may play a role in sustaining binge eating behavior. These clinical reports, however, are limited and often conflicting. In this study, we used a limited access rat model of binge-like behavior in order to further explore the effects of binge eating on cognition. In binge eating prone (BEP) rats, we found novel object recognition (NOR) as well as Barnes maze reversal learning (BM-RL) deficits. Aberrant gene expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) in the hippocampus (HPC)-prefrontal cortex (PFC) network was observed in BEP rats. Additionally, the NOR deficits were correlated with reductions in the expression of TrkB and insulin receptor (Ir) in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Furthermore, up-regulation of serotonin-2C (5-HT2C) receptors in the orbitoprefrontal cortex (OFC) was associated with BM-RL deficit. Finally, in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), we found decreased dopamine receptor 2 (Drd2) expression among BEP rats. Taken together, these data suggest that binge eating vegetable shortening may induce contextual and reversal learning deficits which may be mediated, at least in part, by the altered expression of genes in the CA3-OFC-NAc neural network.","Cognitive impairment and gene expression alterations in a rodent model of binge eating disorder.","Physiology & behavior","Chawla A and Cordner ZA and Boersma G and Moran TH","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc),no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 19:16:35,-1,2021-03-05 22:43:01,,,,,,,,

Four groups of rats are used: one subjected to cyclic food restriction, another to acute footshock stress, another to both of these (R + S), and a control. Neither cyclic restriction nor stress alone produces binge eating, but the R + S rats, despite satiety, double their intake of palatable food in a discrete period of time (i.e., binge) when stressed. This protocol recapitulates critical properties of human binge eating, namely preference for palatable food, dieting- and stress-induced vulnerability to binging, and eating for reward versus metabolic need.

A restricted daily feeding schedule was next imposed, such that pressing one lever provided food for a limited duration (1 or 2 hr) at one time of day while pressing the second lever provided food for the same duration at another time of day.

We tested the ability of a Ca2+ channel blocker, diltiazem, to alter food intake in hyperphagic rats when administered using the intranasal (i.n.), intraperitoneal (i.p.), oral (p.o.) or intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) routes of administration.

Rats then learned to obtain Chow A/I pellets under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement and were assigned to two matched groups. Each week, one group (n = 15) was diet-cycled, receiving Chow A/I for 5 days followed by the Preferred diet for 2 days. Controls received Chow A/I daily (n = 14). Progressive ratio sessions were performed daily during the 5 days that all subjects received Chow A/I in the home cage. Across 5 wk, diet-cycled rats progressively ate less of the otherwise palatable Chow A/I diet. Hypophagia was not due to greater prior intake or weight gain, motor impairment, or facilitated satiation and was associated with changes in progressive ratio performance that suggested a reduced reinforcing efficacy of the Chow A/I diet in diet-cycled animals.

The food-restricted, but not the fed females, varied significantly over the estrous cycle in appetitive behaviors, which included their preference for males versus food and in the amount of food hoarded, with low food hoarding and high male preference on the night of ovulation. In contrast, there were no significant differences between restricted and ad libitum-fed females in the consummatory behaviors, namely, food intake or lordosis duration. In ovariectomized females, estradiol plus progesterone treatment delayed food restriction-stimulated hoarding and hastened feeding-inhibited hoarding without affecting food intake or lordosis duration. In summary, energy restriction and the presence of males unmasked an effect that was obscured in the normal laboratory conditions characterized by isolation and an over abundance of readily available food.

In rats, the preference for sweet foods may involve estrogen-mediated changes in response to the taste of sweets. Our recent work showed that ovariectomized female rats lick less to dilute sucrose solutions when given estrogen than when given the oil vehicle. These findings suggest that estrogen decreases the preference for less concentrated sucrose solutions; however, an alternative explanation is that estrogen interferes with the ability to detect dilute sucrose solutions. To distinguish between these possibilities, we conditioned a taste aversion to 0.2 M sucrose in ovariectomized rats by pairing it with injection of LiCl and then examined the generalization of that taste aversion to 0.075 and 0.025 M sucrose solutions during estrogen or oil treatment. Oil-treated rats generalized the LiCl-induced aversion conditioned to 0.2 M sucrose to both 0.075 and 0.025 M sucrose. Estrogen-treated rats generalized the LiCl-induced taste aversion to 0.075 M sucrose but not to 0.025 M sucrose. Moreover, two weeks later, when estrogen had cleared the system, both groups generalized the aversion to both 0.075 and 0.025 M sucrose. These results show that estrogen affects the ability to discriminate dilute sucrose from water and suggest that estrogen may have short-term effects on the detection threshold for sucrose taste in rats.","Estrogen increases the taste threshold for sucrose in rats.","Physiology & behavior","Curtis KS and Stratford JM and Contreras RJ","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 19:02:24,-1,2021-03-05 22:50:45,,,,,,,,

To mimic human 'binge-like' inhalant intoxication, adolescent, male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to toluene vapor (5700ppm) twice daily for five consecutive days. These rats remained in their home cages until adulthood (P60), when they were trained in operant boxes to respond to a palatable food reward and then challenged with several different cognitive tasks. Rats that experienced chronic exposure to toluene plus abstinence ('CTA') showed enhanced performance in a strategy set-shifting task using a between-session, but not a within-session test design. CTA also blunted operant and classical conditioning without affecting responding during a progressive ratio task. While CTA rats displayed normal latent inhibition, previous exposure to a non-reinforced cue enhanced extinction of classically conditioned approach behavior of these animals compared to air controls. To determine whether CTA alters the structural plasticity of brain areas involved in set-shifting and appetitive behaviors, we quantified basal dendritic spine morphology in DiI-labeled pyramidal neurons in layer 5 of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). There were no changes in dendritic spine density or subtype in the mPFC of CTA rats while NAc spine density was significantly increased due to an enhanced prevalence of long-thin spines. Together, these findings suggest that the persistent effects of CTA on cognition are related to learning and memory consolidation/recall, but not mPFC-dependent behavioral flexibility.","Persistent cognitive and morphological alterations induced by repeated exposure of adolescent rats to the abused inhalant toluene.","Neurobiology of learning and memory","Braunscheidel KM and Gass JT and Mulholland PJ and Floresco SB and Woodward JJ","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 18:52:44,-1,2021-03-05 22:51:15,,,,,,,,

Translational automated tests can be applied in humans and animals to study operant reward behaviour, aetio-pathophysiology underlying deficits therein, and effects of antidepressant treatment. Three inter-related experiments were conducted to investigate depression-relevant effects of chronic psychosocial stress on operant behaviour in mice. (A) Non-manipulated mice were trained on a complex reversal learning (CRL) test with sucrose reinforcement; relative to vehicle (VEH), acute antidepressant agomelatine (AGO, 25mg/kg p.o.) increased reversals. (B) Mice underwent chronic social defeat (CSD) or control handling (CON) on days 1-15, and were administered AGO or VEH on days 10-22. In a progressive ratio schedule motivation test for sucrose on day 15, CSD mice made fewer responses; AGO tended to reverse this effect. In a CRL test on day 22, CSD mice completed fewer reversals; AGO tended to increase reversals in CSD mice associated with an adaptive increase in perseveration. (C) Mice with continuous operant access to water and saccharin solution in the home cage were exposed to CSD or CON; CSD mice made fewer responses for saccharin and water and drank less saccharin in the active period, and drank more water in the inactive period. In a separate CSD cohort, repeated AGO was without effect on these home cage operant and consummatory changes. Overall, this study demonstrates that psychosocial stress in mice leads to depression-relevant decreases in motivation and cognition in operant reward tests; partial reversal of these deficits by AGO provides evidence for predictive validity.","Mouse psychosocial stress reduces motivation and cognitive function in operant reward tests: A model for reward pathology with effects of agomelatine.","European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Bergamini G and Cathomas F and Auer S and Sigrist H and Seifritz E and Patterson M and Gabriel C and Pryce CR","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 23:13:14,-1,2021-03-05 22:52:16,,,,,,,,

This effect has previously been interpreted to reflect a sensitization of reward. In the present study a curve-shift method was used to explicitly differentiate effects of food restriction on brain stimulation rewarding efficacy and performance. Food restriction consistently shifted rate-frequency curves to the left, lowering the M-50 and Theta-0 parameters of rewarding efficacy. Asymptotic rates of reinforcement and slopes of rate-frequency functions were unaffected, confirming that food restriction does not facilitate LHSS by enhancing performance. In this and previous studies, LHSS in food-restricted rats was measured in the period immediately preceding the daily meal when hunger (i.e., period since last meal) and plasma corticosterone are at peak levels. In the light of evidence that corticosterone may regulate sensitivity of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway and account for the sensitizing effect of stress on psychomotor effects of opiates and stimulants, LHSS and corticosterone were measured in the immediate pre-and post-meal periods. While all food-restricted rats displayed elevated corticosterone levels in the pre-meal period and generally displayed a decline to control levels in the post-meal period, the sensitization of reward was not reversed in the post-meal period. These results indicate that chronic food restriction produces a sensitization of reward that does not depend upon the acute state of hunger that precedes the daily meal and does not vary with dynamic changes in plasma corticosterone level.","Curve-shift analysis of self-stimulation in food-restricted rats: relationship between daily meal, plasma corticosterone and reward sensitization.","Brain research","Abrahamsen GC and Berman Y and Carr KD","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc),no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-24 19:26:43,-1,2021-03-05 22:53:03,,,,,,,,

Brain-responsive neurostimulation guided by the delta band was previously found to block binge-eating behavior in mice. Following novel preclinical work and a human case study demonstrating an association between the delta band and reward anticipation, the US Food and Drug Administration approved an Investigational Device Exemption for a first-in-human study. OBJECTIVE: To assess feasibility, safety, and nonfutility of brain-responsive neurostimulation for LOC eating in treatment-refractory obesity. METHODS: This is a single-site, early feasibility study with a randomized, single-blinded, staggered-onset design. Six subjects will undergo bilateral brain-responsive neurostimulation of the nucleus accumbens for LOC eating using the RNS(R) System (NeuroPace Inc). Eligible participants must have treatment-refractory obesity with body mass index >/= 45 kg/m2. Electrophysiological signals of LOC will be characterized using real-time recording capabilities coupled with synchronized video monitoring. Effects on other eating disorder pathology, mood, neuropsychological profile, metabolic syndrome, and nutrition will also be assessed. EXPECTED OUTCOMES: Safety/feasibility of brain-responsive neurostimulation of the nucleus accumbens will be examined. The primary success criterion is a decrease of >/=1 LOC eating episode/week based on a 28-d average in >/=50% of subjects after 6 mo of responsive neurostimulation.

Wheel running and bar pressing for food were continuously recorded from rats which had concurrent access to both wheels and food. In a second condition, wheel running and (non-reinforced) bar pressing were recorded during food deprivation. In a third condition, bar pressing for food was recorded while wheel running was prevented. During ad lib access to wheels and food, both behaviors occurred primarily during the dark phase of the light-dark cycle. However, the nocturnal distribution of these responses differed: the early dark hours were primarily devoted to running, while feeding occurred in small, frequent meals. Maximal food intake occurred during the late dark hours, when meals were larger and less frequent, and there was little running. During three days of complete food deprivation, both wheel running and meal initiation attempts (as indicated by nonreinforced bar pressing) maintained their normal daily patterns. However, during wheel deprivation, changes occurred in the temporal distribution of meals which equalized early and late dark food intake. These results show that the availability of an alternative activity, like wheel running, can be an important determinant of daily feeding patterns. However, the daily pattern of wheel running is not influenced by food availability.

The regulatory network that transduces hormonal and circadian signals serves to integrate these physiological cues and adjust glucose synthesis and secretion by the liver. In this study, we identified ubiquitin-specific protease 2 (USP2) as an inducible regulator of hepatic gluconeogenesis that responds to nutritional status and clock. Adenoviral-mediated expression of USP2 in the liver promotes hepatic glucose production and exacerbates glucose intolerance in diet-induced obese mice. In contrast, in vivo RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown of this factor improves systemic glycemic control. USP2 is a target gene of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha), a coactivator that integrates clock and energy metabolism, and is required for maintaining diurnal glucose homeostasis during restricted feeding. At the mechanistic level, USP2 regulates hepatic glucose metabolism through its induction of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (HSD1) and glucocorticoid signaling in the liver. Pharmacological inhibition and liver-specific RNAi knockdown of HSD1 significantly impair the stimulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis by USP2.

Besides these well-documented functions, they are also thought to control feeding behavior. In particular, optogenetic and pharmacogenetic interventions to LS-projecting vHip neurons have demonstrated that the vHip(-->LS) neural circuit exerts an inhibition on feeding behavior. However, there have been no reports of vHip neuronal activity during feeding. Here, we focused on LS-projecting vCA1 neurons (vCA1(-->LS) ) and monitored their activity during feeding behaviors in mice. vCA1(-->LS) neurons were retrogradely labeled with adeno-associated virus carrying a ratiometric Ca(2+) indicator and measured compound Ca(2+) dynamics by fiber photometry. We first examined vCA1(-->LS) activity in random food-exploring behavior and found that vCA1(-->LS) activation seemed to coincide with food intake; however, our ability to visually confirm this during freely moving behaviors was not sufficiently reliable. We next examined vCA1(-->LS) activity in a goal-directed, food-seeking lever-press task which temporally divided the mouse state into preparatory, effort, and consummatory phases. We observed vCA1(-->LS) activation in the postprandial period during the consummatory phase. Such timing- and pathway-specific activation was not observed from pan-vCA1 neurons. In contrast, reward omission eliminated this activity, indicating that vCA1(-->LS) activation is contingent on the food reward. Sated mice pressed the lever significantly fewer times but still ate food; however, vCA1(-->LS) neurons were not activated, suggesting that vCA1(-->LS) neurons did not respond to habitual behavior. Combined, these results suggest that gastrointestinal interoception rather than food-intake motions or external sensations are likely to coincide with vCA1(-->LS) activity. Accordingly, we propose that vCA1(-->LS) neurons discriminate between matched or unmatched predictive bodily states in which incoming food will satisfy an appetite. We also demonstrate that vCA1(-->LS) neurons are activated in aversive/anxious situations in an elevated plus maze and tail suspension test. Future behavioral tests utilizing anxious conflict and food intake may reconcile the multiple functions of vCA1(-->LS) neurons.","Activation of ventral CA1 hippocampal neurons projecting to the lateral septum during feeding.","Hippocampus","Kosugi K and Yoshida K and Suzuki T and Kobayashi K and Yoshida K and Mimura M and Tanaka KF","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-27 19:56:11,-1,2021-03-11 03:47:34,,,,,,,,

Moreover, we tested the hypothesis that low accumbal D2 receptor (R) availability is a genetic risk factor of food compulsion-like behavior and that environmental conditions that induce compulsive eating alter D2R expression in the striatum. To this end, we measured D1R and D2R expression in the striatum and D1R, D2R and alpha1R levels in the medial prefrontal cortex, respectively, by western blot. RESULTS: Exposure to environmental conditions induces compulsion-like eating behavior, depending on genetic background. This behavioral pattern is linked to decreased availability of accumbal D2R. Moreover, exposure to certain environmental conditions upregulates D2R and downregulates alpha1R in the striatum and medial prefrontal cortex, respectively, of compulsive animals. These findings confirm the function of gene-environment interplay in the manifestation of compulsive eating and support the hypothesis that low accumbal D2R availability is a 'constitutive' genetic risk factor for compulsion-like eating behavior.

To shed additional light on the neurological consequences of HFD consumption in female rodents and to determine the relatively early impact of HFD in the likely continuum of neurological dysfunction in the context of chronic HFD intake, this study investigated effects of HFD feeding for up to 12weeks on selected behavioral, neurochemical, and electrophysiological parameters in adult female C57BL/6 mice; particular focus was placed on the ventral hippocampus (vHIP). Selected locomotor, emotional and cognitive functions were evaluated using behavioral tests after 5weeks on HFD or control (low-fat diet) diets. One week later, mice were sacrificed and brain regional neurochemical (monoamine) analysis was performed. Behaviorally naive mice were maintained on their respective diets for an additional 5-6weeks at which time synaptic plasticity was determined in ex vivo slices from the vHIP. HFD-fed female mice exhibited increased: (i) locomotor activity in the open field testing, (ii) mean turn time on the pole test, (iii) swimming time in the forced swim test, and (iv) number of marbles buried in the marble burying test. In contrast, the novel object recognition memory was unaffected. Mice on HFD also had decreased norepinephrine and dopamine turnover, respectively, in the prefrontal cortex and the vHIP. HFD consumption for a total of 11-12weeks altered vHIP synaptic plasticity, evidenced by significant reductions in the paired-pulse ratio and long-term potentiation (LTP) magnitude. In summary, in female mice, HFD intake for several weeks induced multiple behavioral alterations of mainly anxiety-like nature and impaired monoamine pathways in a brain region-specific manner, suggesting that in the female, certain behavioral domains (anxiety) and associated brain regions, i.e., the vHIP, are preferentially targeted by HFD.","Neurochemical and electrophysiological deficits in the ventral hippocampus and selective behavioral alterations caused by high-fat diet in female C57BL/6 mice.","Neuroscience","Krishna S and Keralapurath MM and Lin Z and Wagner JJ and de La Serre CB and Harn DA and Filipov NM","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 19:15:47,-1,2021-03-06 17:46:56,,,,,,,,

Daytime restricted feeding (DRF) modifies the circadian control and uncouples the light-dependent physiological rhythmicity, food access becoming the principal external time cue. In these conditions, an alternative biological clock is expressed, the food-entrainable oscillator (FEO). Glucocorticoid hormones are an important part of the humoral mechanisms in the daily synchronisation of the metabolic response of peripheral oscillators by the timing system. A peak of circulating corticosterone has been reported before food access in DRF protocols. In the present study we explored in the liver the 24 h variations of: (1) the subcellular distribution of glucocorticoid receptor (GCR), (2) the activities of the corticosterone-forming and NADPH-generating enzymes (11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD-1) and hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH)), and, (3) parameters related with the urea cycle (circulating urea and activities of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase and ornithine transcarbamylase) elicited by DRF. The results showed that DRF promoted an increase of more than two times of the hepatic GCR, but exclusively in the cytosolic compartment, since the GCR in the nuclear fraction showed a reduction. No changes were observed in the activities of 11beta-HSD-1 and H6PDH, but the rhythmicity of all of the urea cycle-related parameters was modified.

Unfortunately, the majority of diets fail leading to weight regain and in some cases, pathological feeding behavior. We hypothesize that alternating bouts of caloric overconsumption and caloric restriction, behavioral manifestations of dieting induce neuroendocrine, behavioral and genetic changes that promote future bouts of palatable food intake. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we subjected male Long-Evans rats to a high-fat diet (HFD) feeding paradigm that induced a pattern of caloric overconsumption and caloric restriction. Under these conditions we measured operant responding for sucrose, pre-meal ghrelin secretion, the effects of peripheral ghrelin blockade on patterned feeding, HFD intake in an aversive environment and mRNA expression of the ghrelin receptor, orexin, orexin-1 and 2 receptors, and FTO in the medial prefrontal cortex, lateral hypothalamus and ventral tegmental area. RESULTS: Rats subjected to this feeding regimen displayed increased ghrelin levels prior to HFD exposure and blockade of this response attenuated patterned feeding behavior. In addition, patterned feeding promoted enhanced motivation for sucrose, diminished extinction of this response and increased HFD intake in an aversive environment. The neuroendocrine and behavioral changes correlated with increased hypothalamic expression of the ghrelin receptor and FTO. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these data indicate that patterns of feeding that include caloric overconsumption and caloric restriction induce neuroendocrine and neurobiological changes that signify an enhanced drive for palatable food.","Patterned feeding induces neuroendocrine, behavioral and genetic changes that promote palatable food intake.","International journal of obesity (2005)","Sirohi S and Van Cleef A and Davis JF","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",1,2021-03-18 21:26:31,0,2021-02-22 23:09:15,-1,2021-03-06 17:47:35,,,,,,,,

We previously characterized a limited sucrose intake (LSI) paradigm in which twice-daily access to a small amount of 30% sucrose (vs. water as a control) reduces hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis responses to stress and alters neuronal activation in stress-regulatory brain regions in male rats. However, women may be more prone to 'comfort feeding' behaviors than men, and stress-related eating may vary across the menstrual cycle. This suggests that LSI effects may be sex- and estrous cycle-dependent. The present study therefore investigated the effects of LSI on HPA axis stress responsivity, as well as markers of neuronal activation/plasticity in stress- and reward-related neurocircuitry in female rats across the estrous cycle. We found that LSI reduced post-restraint stress plasma ACTH in female rats specifically during proestrus/estrus (P/E). LSI also increased basal (non-stress) FosB/deltaFosB- and pCREB-immunolabeling in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and central amygdala specifically during P/E. Finally, Bayesian network modeling of the FosB/deltaFosB and pCREB expression data identified a neurocircuit that includes the BLA, nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis as likely being modified by LSI during P/E. When considered in the context of our prior results, the present findings suggest that palatable food reduces stress responses in female rats similar to males, but in an estrous cycle-dependent manner. Further, the BLA may contribute to the LSI effects in both sexes, whereas the involvement of other brain regions appears to be sex-dependent.","Palatable Food Affects HPA Axis Responsivity and Forebrain Neurocircuitry in an Estrous Cycle-specific Manner in Female Rats.","Neuroscience","Egan AE and Thompson AMK and Buesing D and Fourman SM and Packard AEB and Terefe T and Li D and Wang X and Song S and Solomon MB and Ulrich-Lai YM","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-26 14:51:28,-1,2021-03-06 17:47:59,,,,,,,,

In Experiment 1, mice responded for sucrose pellets and then water reinforcement under four different MOs: food deprivation, water deprivation, concurrent food and water deprivation, and no deprivation. The most responding for pellets occurred under food deprivation and the most responding for water occurred under water deprivation. Concurrent food and water deprivation decreased responding for both reinforcers. Nevertheless, water deprivation alone increased pellet-reinforced responding and food deprivation alone likewise increased water-reinforced responding relative to no deprivation. Experiment 2 demonstrated that presession food during concurrent food and water deprivation increased in-session responding for water relative to sessions where no presession food was provided. Conversely, presession water during concurrent food and water deprivation did not increase in-session responding for pellets. These results suggest that a) the reinforcing value of a single stimulus can be affected by multiple MOs, b) a single MO can affect the reinforcing value of multiple stimuli, and c) reinforcing events can also function as MOs.

In both cases, the scheduled pattern of food-approach behavior elicited dissociation of the feeding activity into several components associated to the feeding times (CAFT), which coexisted with the previous circadian free-running rhythms. In LL rats and in the rest phase of DD animals, the CAFT was characterized by an increased number of food approaches confined exclusively to the period of food availability, with poor anticipatory activity. However, in the active phase of some DD rats, CAFT included an additional anticipatory activity. The interaction between the CAFT and the free-running rhythms involved modulation of the CAFT, depending on the free-running periodicity. After termination of the feeding-restriction schedule, some DD and LL animals retained the CAFT for at least 3 days. However, when the access to food was blocked 10 days after ending the restricted schedule, rats did not show any feeding activity associated to the previous feeding times. A spontaneous feeding pattern similar to that imposed by the previous feeding schedule emerged immediately after food deprivation in two of the DD animals.

A proposed treatment for dietary-induced obesity is time-restricted feeding (TRF), which restricts consumption of food to specific times of the 24-hour cycle. Although TRF shows great promise to prevent obesity and the development of chronic disease, the effects of TRF to reverse metabolic changes and the development of NAFLD in animal models of a Western diet with sugary water consumption is not known. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the current study was to evaluate the role of TRF in the treatment of obesity and NAFLD through examination of changes in metabolic and histopathologic parameters. METHODS: To better understand the role of TRF in the treatment of obesity and NAFLD, we investigated the metabolic phenotype and NAFLD parameters in a mouse model of NAFLD in which obesity and liver steatosis are induced by a Western Diet (WD): a high-fat diet of lard, milkfat and Crisco with sugary drinking water. Mice were subjected to a short-term (4-weeks) and long-term (10-weeks) TRF in which food was restricted to 9h at night. RESULTS: Prior to TRF treatment, the WD mice had increased body mass, and exhibited less activity, and higher average daytime energy expenditure (EE) than chow fed mice. Approximately 4- and 10-weeks following TFR treatment, WD-TRF had moderate but not statistically significant weight loss compared to WD-ad libitum (WD-AL) mice. There was a modest but significant reduction in the inguinal adipose tissue weight in both WD-TRF groups compared to the WD-AL groups; however, there was no difference in epididymal and retroperitoneal adipose tissue mass or adipocyte size distribution. In contrast, the diet-induced increase in normalized liver tissue weight, hepatic triglyceride, and NAFLD score was partially abrogated in the 4-week WD-TRF mice, while systemic insulin resistance was partially abrogated and glucose intolerance was completely abrogated in the 10-week WD-TRF mice. Importantly, WD-induced metabolic dysfunction (substrate utilization, energy expenditure, and activity) was partially abrogated by 4- and 10-week TRF. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that TRF aids in reducing the detrimental metabolic effects of consuming a WD with sugary drinking water but does not ameliorate obesity.","Restricted feeding for 9h in the active period partially abrogates the detrimental metabolic effects of a Western diet with liquid sugar consumption in mice.","Metabolism: clinical and experimental","Woodie LN and Luo Y and Wayne MJ and Graff EC and Ahmed B and O'Neill AM and Greene MW","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,2021-03-18 21:33:23,1,2021-02-24 18:37:08,-1,2021-03-06 17:50:56,,,,,,,,

The neurobiology of BED is poorly understood. Brain dopamine, which regulates motivation for food intake, is likely to be involved. We assessed the involvement of brain dopamine in the motivation for food consumption in binge eaters. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans with [(11)C]raclopride were done in 10 obese BED and 8 obese subjects without BED. Changes in extracellular dopamine in the striatum in response to food stimulation in food-deprived subjects were evaluated after placebo and after oral methylphenidate (MPH), a drug that blocks the dopamine reuptake transporter and thus amplifies dopamine signals. Neither the neutral stimuli (with or without MPH) nor the food stimuli when given with placebo increased extracellular dopamine. The food stimuli when given with MPH significantly increased dopamine in the caudate and putamen in the binge eaters but not in the nonbinge eaters. Dopamine increases in the caudate were significantly correlated with the binge eating scores but not with BMI. These results identify dopamine neurotransmission in the caudate as being of relevance to the neurobiology of BED.

Chronic stress, particularly during adolescence, is a significant risk factor for BED in women, but the mechanism underlying this relationship remains elusive. We investigated the phenomenon by testing the impact of mid-adolescent intermittent physical stress (IPS) on binge-like intake of sucrose in adult female rats, assessing how the behavior changed across reproductive cycles. One hundred and nineteen Long-Evans rats were exposed to IPS (n = 59) or no stress (NS; n = 60) for 12 days during mid-adolescence (PD35-46). Binge-like eating was induced in adult animals using an intermittent access protocol: animals were provided with 12 h or 24 h access to sucrose, 12 h access to saccharin, or 12 h access to food over 28 days. After 1- or 28-day abstinence, compulsive responding for sucrose was measured using a conditioned suppression paradigm. Rats given 12 h access to sucrose developed binge-like intake, measured as increased consumption during the first hour; the effect was magnified in IPS animals and most pronounced during proestrous. Solution intake in IPS rats was predicted by open arm entries in the elevated plus maze, suggesting that increased risk-taking behavior is associated with greater binge-like eating. IPS blocked conditioned suppression after 28 days of abstinence, pointing to a role of mid-adolescent stress in compulsivity. Collectively, these findings emphasize the impact of stress on the emergence of binge eating in females and suggest that intervention programs for women with a history of adolescent adversity should be investigated as a means to reduce risk for BED.","Mid-adolescent stress differentially affects binge-like intake of sucrose across estrous cycles in female rats().","Physiology & behavior","Lamontagne SJ and Wilkin MM and Menard JL and Olmstead MC","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",1,2021-03-18 21:35:19,1,2021-02-20 20:27:53,-1,2021-03-06 17:52:24,,,,,,,,

The present study was designed to establish if the alterations of the circadian rhythms induced by timed hypocaloric food restriction are accompanied by structural changes in the SCN. Two groups of adult rats, both maintained on 12-h light/12-h dark cycles, were used; in one group, animals had permanent free access to food, whereas in the other they were subjected to a restricted hypocaloric early morning feeding during 7 months. Using stereological techniques and in situ hybridization, we have examined the structure of the SCN and the synthesis and expression of vasopressin (AVP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). The volume of the SCN and the total number of neurons did not vary between the two groups. However, the total number of AVP- and VIP-immunoreactive neurons and the AVP and VIP mRNA levels were significantly decreased in timed hypocaloric food-restricted animals. The results indicate that timed hypocaloric food restriction has led to changes of AVP and VIP content of the neurons.

Environmental signals associated with food may prepare an animal to forage, consume and digest more effectively. Furthermore, environmental cues that provide information about food availability enable animals to make predictions about future food resources and act upon that knowledge in appropriate fashion. For example, when exposed to a cue that signals the presence of food, animals can eat beyond their present needs to cope with predicted future famine. Interestingly, cues previously paired with meal interruption have a similar effect. In two experiments, food-deprived rats learned to associate one conditioned stimulus (CS+) with delivery of a food unconditioned stimulus (US), and another stimulus (IS) with an unexpected termination of CS-US trials. Subsequently, both CS+ and IS enhanced consumption of the US food by sated rats. The results of Experiment 2 indicated that IS's ability to potentiate feeding of sated rats in test depended more on its accompanying CS+ termination in training than on its signaling reductions in US frequency.

The results of this study indicate that the effects of baclofen on food intake may be related to the state of hunger or satiety of the animals and the time during the light-dark cycle when the drug is administered.","Effects of intraperitoneal administration of the GABA B receptor agonist baclofen on food intake in rats measured under different feeding conditions.","European journal of pharmacology","Ebenezer IS and Patel SM","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 22:47:46,-1,2021-03-06 17:53:17,,,,,,,,

Whereas increases in PC mRNA have been observed during feed restriction, the mechanism of regulation is unknown; however, coinciding increases in circulating NEFA concentrations suggests that fatty acids may contribute to regulation of gene expression during feed restriction. The objective of this study was to examine the direct effect of exposure to serum from full-fed control cows with serum from cows that were restricted to 50% of ad libitum intake for 5 d on PC expression in vitro. Rat hepatoma (H4IIE) cells were transiently transfected with bovine promoter-luciferase constructs containing bovine PC promoter 1 and treated with serum from control cows, serum from feed-restricted cows, or modified serum. Modified serum pools were generated by supplemented serum from control cows with C14:0, C16:0, C18:0, C18:1n-9 cis, C18:2n-6 cis, and C18:3n-3 cis to match the total NEFA in serum from feed-restricted cows (1.3 mM) in the relative proportion found in serum from control or feed-restricted cows. Exposure of cells to serum from feed-restricted cows increased (P < 0.05) PC promoter 1 activity 2.2-fold compared with cells exposed to control cow serum. Exposure to serum from control cows with fatty acids added to a NEFA concentration of 1.3 mM to reflect the fatty acid profile of control and feed-restricted cows increased (P < 0.05) promoter 1 activity 2.1- and 2.5-fold, respectively, compared with cells incubated with control cow serum. There was no difference (P >/= 0.05) in promoter 1 activity in cells treated with modified serum compared with serum from feed-restricted cows. These data indicate that promoter 1 is activated by fatty acids found in serum of feed-restricted cows.

We examined behavioral and molecular outcomes in mice that were given chronic exposure to a high-fat diet (HFD; 12weeks), with the onset of the diet either in adolescence or adulthood. To examine whether observed effects could be reversed upon removal of the HFD, animals were also studied 4weeks after a return to chow feeding. Most notably, female mice, particularly those exposed to HFD starting in adolescence, demonstrated the emergence of binge-like behavior when given restricted access to a palatable food. Further, changes in dopamine-related gene expression and dopamine content in the prefrontal cortex were observed. Some of these HFD-driven phenotypes reversed upon removal of the diet, whereas others were initiated by removal of the diet. These findings have implications for obesity management and interventions, as both pharmacological and behavioral therapies are often combined with dietary interventions (e.g., reduction in calorie dense foods).","Removal of high-fat diet after chronic exposure drives binge behavior and dopaminergic dysregulation in female mice.","Neuroscience","Carlin JL and McKee SE and Hill-Smith T and Grissom NM and George R and Lucki I and Reyes TM","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,2021-03-18 21:36:15,0,2021-02-22 19:07:12,-1,2021-03-06 17:53:49,,,,,,,,

Although the anatomical substrates and underlying mechanisms of the food-entrainable oscillator are not well understood, experimental evidence indicates that it involves multiple structures and systems. Using rabbit pups entrained to circadian nursing as a natural model of food restriction, we hypothesized that the anterior piriform cortex (APCx) and the olfactory tubercle (OTu) are activated during nursing-associated FAA. Two groups of litters were entrained to one of two different nursing times. At postnatal day 7, when litters showed clear FAA, pups from each litter were euthanized at nursing time, or 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 or 20h later. Neural metabolic activities of the APCx, OTu, olfactory bulb (OB) and suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) were assessed by cytochrome oxidase histochemistry. Additionally, two fasted groups were nurse-deprived for two cycles before being euthanized at postnatal day 9. In nursed pups, metabolic activity of APCx, OTu and OB increased during FAA and after feeding, independently of the geographical time. Metabolic activity in SCN was not affected by nursing schedule. Given that APCx and OTu are in a key network position to integrate temporal odor signals with body energetic state, brain arousal and reward mechanisms, we suggest that these structures could be an important part of the conditioned oscillatory mechanism that leads to food entrainment.","Circadian feeding entrains anticipatory metabolic activity in piriform cortex and olfactory tubercle, but not in suprachiasmatic nucleus.","Brain research","Olivo D and Caba M and Gonzalez-Lima F and Vazquez A and Corona-Morales A","study with other mammals other than rat mice,study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-02-26 14:59:35,-1,2021-03-06 17:54:03,,,,,,,,

Knockout mice consumed less solution and food during the first hour as well as less food each day compared with wildtype mice. Limited access groups consumed more food and gained more weight than continuous access groups, and the effect was magnified in saccharin-consuming mice. Indeed, the increased food consumption in animals given limited access to saccharin was so excessive that caloric intake of this group was significantly higher than either of the sucrose groups (limited or continuous access).

In later cycles, they responded similarly. The present study was undertaken to determine if this finding was due to age, adaptation to the intervention or the obesity. Adult (35-wk-old) lean and obese rats were classified into four groups, ad libitum-fed lean and obese and food-restricted lean and obese. Food-restricted rats underwent four 3-wk periods when they were fed 50% of their ad libitum intake, each followed by a 3-wk period of ad libitum refeeding. Food-restricted rats lost and regained sufficient weight in each cycle to weigh a similar amount as their ad libitum-fed groups by the end of each refeeding period. In lean rats, there were no permanent effects of this intervention except for a 25% reduction in carbohydrate intake. Similar results were found in obese rats, although they did have significantly lower retroperitoneal fat pad weight and serum triacylglycerol levels than ad libitum-fed obese rats at the end of the experiment. These results indicate that lean and obese adult rats respond to each food restriction/refeeding cycle in a similar manner.

It is well-known that entrainment of the activity rhythm to the light-dark cycle is attained by the circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Locomotor activity is also controlled by two extra-SCN oscillators; periodic food availability entrains the food-entrainable oscillator (FEO) and constant consumption of low-dose methamphetamine reveals the output of the methamphetamine-sensitive circadian oscillator (MASCO). In this study, we sought to investigate the relationship between the SCN, FEO, and MASCO by examining the combinatorial effects of light, food restriction, and/or methamphetamine on locomotor activity. To investigate coupling between the SCN and FEO, we tested whether food anticipatory activity, which is the output of the FEO, shifted coordinately with phase shifts of the light-dark cycle. We found that the phase of food anticipatory activity was phase-delayed or phase-advanced symmetrically with the respective shift of the light-dark cycle, suggesting that the FEO is strongly coupled to the SCN and the phase angle between the SCN and FEO is maintained during ad libitum feeding. To examine the effect of methamphetamine on the output of the FEO, we administered methamphetamine to mice undergoing restricted feeding and found that food-entrained activity was delayed by methamphetamine treatment. In addition, restricted feeding induced dissociation of the MASCO and SCN activity rhythms during short-term methamphetamine treatment, when these rhythms are typically integrated.

In the first experiment, body weight and vaginal smears were monitored daily. Fluoxetine treatment reduced body weight within the first 24 h of treatment. Fluoxetine treatment also elongated the estrous cycle, reduced blood levels of progesterone, and eliminated lordosis behavior. In the second experiment, body weight and food intake were examined and a pair-fed group was included to determine if fluoxetine-induced anorexia contributed to the disturbance of the estrous cycle. In pair-fed rats, effects similar to fluoxetine treatment were present. These results lead to the suggestion that fluoxetine's anorectic properties could disrupt the female's normal endocrine cyclicity and that this disruption could be relevant to the reduction in sexual behavior and motivation. However, when the duration of fluoxetine treatment was extended beyond 16 to 17 days, fluoxetine-treated female rats reinitiated vaginal cyclicity and showed evidence of normal sexual receptivity. In contrast, the estrous cycles of their pair-fed counterparts remained disrupted. Thus, restricted food intake appears to contribute to the disruption of the estrous cycle and elimination of sexual receptivity during fluoxetine treatment. However, compensatory changes in the serotonergic system that are associated with chronic fluoxetine administration may contribute to the gradual recovery of estrous cyclicity and sexual receptivity of the fluoxetine-treated animals.","Fluoxetine disrupts food intake and estrous cyclicity in Fischer female rats.","Brain research","Uphouse L and Hensler JG and Sarkar J and Grossie B","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 20:46:56,-1,2021-03-06 17:56:51,,,,,,,,

Harris, Shand, Carroll, and Westbrook (2004) suggested that this persistence may be due to flavor preference conditioning's producing a long-lasting change in the hedonic response to the conditioned stimulus (CS+) flavor. In the present study, the CS+ flavor was presented in simultaneous compound with 16% sucrose, whereas the CS- flavor was presented with 2% sucrose. During subsequent two- and one-bottle tests, the CS+ and CS- flavors were presented in 2% sucrose. Hedonic reactions during training and test were assessed using an analysis of the microstructure of licking behavior. Conditioning resulted in greater consumption of the CS+ than of the CS- that did not extinguish over repeated two- and one-bottle tests. The mean lick cluster size was higher for the CS+ than for the CS- only on the first cycle of tests. Since lick cluster size can be used as an index of stimulus palatability, the present results indicate that although the hedonic reaction to the CSs did change, this was not maintained across repeated tests. Thus, changes in the hedonic response to the conditioned flavors cannot explain the resistance to the extinction of learned flavor preferences.","A learned flavor preference persists despite the extinction of conditioned hedonic reactions to the cue flavors.","Learning & behavior","Dwyer DM and Pincham HL and Thein T and Harris JA","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 23:21:24,-1,2021-03-06 17:57:48,,,,,,,,

Even though nocturnal rodents prefer to forage at night, daytime food anticipatory activity (FAA) is observed prior to short meals presented at a scheduled time of day. Under this restricted feeding regimen, rodents exhibit two distinct bouts of activity, a nocturnal activity rhythm that is entrained to the light-dark cycle and controlled by the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and a daytime bout of activity that is phase-locked to mealtime. FAA also occurs during food deprivation, suggesting that a food-entrainable oscillator (FEO) keeps time in the absence of scheduled feeding. Previous studies have demonstrated that the FEO is anatomically distinct from the SCN and that FAA is observed in mice lacking some circadian genes essential for timekeeping in the SCN. In the current study, we optimized the conditions for examining FAA during restricted feeding and food deprivation in mice lacking functional BMAL1, which is critical for circadian rhythm generation in the SCN. We found that BMAL1-deficient mice displayed FAA during restricted feeding in 12hr light:12hr dark (12L:12D) and 18L:6D lighting cycles, but distinct activity during food deprivation was observed only in 18L:6D. While BMAL1-deficient mice also exhibited robust FAA during restricted feeding in constant darkness, mice were hyperactive during food deprivation so it was not clear that FAA consistently occurred at the time of previously scheduled food availability. Taken together, our findings suggest that optimization of experimental conditions such as photoperiod may be necessary to visualize FAA in genetically modified mice.

These behaviors include impaired food seeking by both genders in the context of normal levels of exploratory behavior, suggesting impaired olfaction.

FD caused Cc-reversible augmentation or diminution of preoptic norepinephrine (NE) activity in high- versus low-E rats, respectively, and AMPK-independent reductions in hypothalamic NE accumulation in the latter. Nitric oxide (NO) and kisspeptin are key stimulatory signals for the preovulatory LH surge.

Data show that FD curtails reproductive neuroendocrine outflow by hindbrain AMPK-dependent mechanisms in the presence of peak estrous cycle E levels.

Following baseline testing, animals (n=28) were divided into 3 groups that, in different experimental phases, received either estradiol (in subcutaneous capsules), restricted diet (a liquid diet providing 60% of daily caloric requirements) or a combination of those two. An automated arousal behavior monitoring system was used to measure home cage voluntary motor activity and sensory responsiveness, these being components of a new operational definition of 'generalized arousal'. KEY FINDINGS: (1) During the light, all treatments reduced voluntary activity. (2) In the dark, estrogens increased, while estrogens in combination with restricted diet decreased, horizontal activity.

Ad lib food intake was recorded during the subsequent 24 hours. In the day-time 2-DG enhanced food intake. The increase was not dose-dependent.

This inhibition was mainly manifested during the first four hours and was not dose-dependent. However, a dose related compensation during the subsequent hours resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the nocturnal intake. A second expermient indicated that after an overnight fast 2-DG also inhibited the high food intake induced in the day-time. In a third experiment, insulin 10 IV SC combined to 2-DG was shown to further increase food intake in the day-time. At night the combined administration of insulin and 2-DG cancelled their respective opposite effects and no change of food consumption was observed.

We hypothesized that the chronic consumption of caloric (sucrose, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), maltodextrin) and non-caloric (sucralose) solutions under 2-hour intermittent access, alongside the consumption of a high-fat high-sucrose diet, would result in differential obesity-associated metabolic abnormalities in mice. Male C57BL/6 mice had ad libitum access to an HFHS diet and to water (water control group). In addition, some mice had access, 2h/day, 5days/week (randomly chosen) for 12weeks, to different solutions: i) a sucrose solution (2.1kJ/ml), ii) an HFCS solution (2.1kJ/ml), iii) a maltodextrin solution (2.1kJ/ml) and a sucralose solution (60mM) (n=15/group). Despite no changes in total caloric intake, 2h-intermittent access to the sucrose, HFCS or maltodextrin solutions led to increased body weight and accumulation of lipids in the liver when compared to the group consuming water only. The HFCS and sucrose solutions induced a higher fat mass in various fat depots, glucose intolerance, increased glucose oxidation at the expense of lipid oxidation, and a lower hypothalamic expression of NPY in the fasted state. HFCS also reduced proopiomelanocortin expression in the hypothalamus. 2h-intermittent access to sucralose did not result in significant changes in body composition, but caused a stronger expression of CART in the hypothalamus. Finally, sucrose intake showed a trend to increase the expression of various receptors in the nucleus accumbens, linked to dopamine, opioid and endocannabinoid signaling. In conclusion, 2h-intermittent access to caloric solutions (especially those sweetened with sucrose and HFCS), but not sucralose, resulted in adverse metabolic consequences in high-fat high-sucrose-fed mice.","Metabolic effects of intermittent access to caloric or non-caloric sweetened solutions in mice fed a high-caloric diet.","Physiology & behavior","Soto M and Chaumontet C and Even PC and Azzout-Marniche D and Tome D and Fromentin G","",1,,1,2021-02-22 19:04:08,1,2021-03-06 18:00:18,,,,,,,,

Post-mortem levels of serotonin, dopamine, and metabolites were assessed from brain regions key to feeding and reward. RESULTS: A 3 mg/kg dose of fluoxetine without effect in the no-HCR groups suppressed intake of HCR groups, normalizing the binge-eating of HCR/Stress rats. No differences in monoamines were detected in the hypothalamus or tegmentum but a strong positive relationship between accumbens serotonin and dopamine turnover in no-HCR rats was absent in rats with HCR.

These were aimed at distinguishing between a homeostatic control mechanism, in which the rhythmic behaviour itself is part of the causal loop, and a clock mechanism, independent of the behaviour. In 175 experiments, deprivation of food during 3 ultradian cycles in (subjective) daytime did not result in significant changes in the ultradian periodicity of attempts to obtain the food, compared with ad lib, access to food and water. A minor, but significant increase in ultradian activity time (alpha') occurred in the course of the deprivation, but this was compensated by a shorter ultradian rest (rho'). These results were obtained both in intact animals (n = 24), which showed ultradian and circadian rhythmicity in behaviour, and in animals (n = 21) with electrolytic lesions aimed at the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), which lacked the circadian modulation of behaviour. Simultaneous deprivation of water and food in 8 voles without circadian rhythmicity during 40 experiments also did not lead to any change in the ultradian periodicity of feeding attempts. Rest deprivation was studied in 5 SCN lesioned voles, by forcing running wheel activity to continue following spontaneous running. Thus, the experimental activity bout alpha' was artificially lengthened to 2-9 h in 67 experiments. The onset of the subsequent rest episodes occurred independent of the duration of the preceding alpha'. The duration of rho' was dependent on the preceding, experimental alpha' in a periodic fashion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Ongoing ultradian activity rhythms in the common vole, Microtus arvalis, during deprivations of food, water and rest.","Journal of comparative physiology.

Rats were assigned to the following groups: a chow diet; a high-fat diet; a moderate caloric restriction; or a moderate caloric restriction plus refeeding. Some animals in each group were given [1-(14)C]triolein intragastrically, while others received an intraperitoneal injection of 3 mCi (3)H(2)O. All animals were killed by decapitation. The retroperitoneal, visceral epididymal and omental white adipose tissues, brown adipose tissue, liver and blood were immediately removed. The lipid uptake from the diet, in vivo rate of lipogenesis, percentage of fat, lipid profile and leptin concentration were analysed. The high-fat diet promoted an increase in fatty liver (P </= 0.05), adiposity mass (P </= 0.05) and the plasma concentration of leptin (P </= 0.05) and a decreased lipid uptake in white adipose tissue depots (P </= 0.05) in relation to the chow diet. The moderate caloric restriction did not reverse the changes promoted by the high-fat diet but induced a small decrease in adiposity, which was reversed after refeeding, and the animals maintained a dyslipidaemic profile and high fat deposition in the liver. We can conclude that the high-fat diet and subsequent moderate caloric restriction plus refeeding increased the risks of developing visceral obesity, dyslipidaemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which suggests that this type of experimental protocol can be used to study mechanisms related to the metabolic syndrome.","Food restriction and refeeding induces changes in lipid pathways and fat deposition in the adipose and hepatic tissues in rats with diet-induced obesity.","Experimental physiology","Duarte FO and Sene-Fiorese M and Cheik NC and Maria AS and de Aquino AE Jr and Oishi JC and Rossi EA and Garcia de Oliveira Duarte AC and Damaso AR","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc),no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 23:02:15,-1,2021-03-06 18:02:53,,,,,,,,

This phasic signal is proposed to support learning about antecedent cues by signaling discrepancies between actual and expected outcomes, termed a reward prediction error. However, it is unknown whether dopamine neuron prediction error signaling and cue-reward learning are causally linked. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated dopamine neuron activity in rats in two behavioral procedures, associative blocking and extinction, that illustrate the essential function of prediction errors in learning. We observed that optogenetic activation of dopamine neurons concurrent with reward delivery, mimicking a prediction error, was sufficient to cause long-lasting increases in cue-elicited reward-seeking behavior.

If a cue no longer predicts food availability, then animals may adapt accordingly by inhibiting food-seeking responses. Sparsely activated sets of neurons, coined 'neuronal ensembles,' have been shown to encode the strength of reward-cue associations. Although alterations in intrinsic excitability have been shown to underlie many learning and memory processes, little is known about these properties specifically on cue-activated neuronal ensembles. We examined the activation patterns of cue-activated orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell ensembles using wild-type and Fos-GFP mice, which express green fluorescent protein (GFP) in activated neurons, after appetitive conditioning with sucrose and extinction learning. We also investigated the neuronal excitability of recently activated, GFP+ neurons in these brain areas using whole-cell electrophysiology in brain slices. Exposure to a sucrose cue elicited activation of neurons in both the NAc shell and OFC. In the NAc shell, but not the OFC, these activated GFP+ neurons were more excitable than surrounding GFP- neurons. After extinction, the number of neurons activated in both areas was reduced and activated ensembles in neither area exhibited altered excitability. These data suggest that learning-induced alterations in the intrinsic excitability of neuronal ensembles is regulated dynamically across different brain areas. Furthermore, we show that changes in associative strength modulate the excitability profile of activated ensembles in the NAc shell.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Sparsely distributed sets of neurons called 'neuronal ensembles' encode learned associations about food and cues predictive of its availability. Widespread changes in neuronal excitability have been observed in limbic brain areas after associative learning, but little is known about the excitability changes that occur specifically on neuronal ensembles that encode appetitive associations. Here, we reveal that sucrose cue exposure recruited a more excitable ensemble in the nucleus accumbens, but not orbitofrontal cortex, compared with their surrounding neurons. This excitability difference was not observed when the cue's salience was diminished after extinction learning. These novel data provide evidence that the intrinsic excitability of appetitive memory-encoding ensembles is regulated differentially across brain areas and adapts dynamically to changes in associative strength.","Changes in Appetitive Associative Strength Modulates Nucleus Accumbens, But Not Orbitofrontal Cortex Neuronal Ensemble Excitability.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Ziminski JJ and Hessler S and Margetts-Smith G and Sieburg MC and Crombag HS and Koya E","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,2021-03-18 21:40:46,0,2021-02-27 21:58:49,-1,2021-03-12 20:38:04,,,,,,,,

Transgenic mice lacking NMU are hyperphagic and obese, making NMU a novel target for understanding and treating obesity. Neuromedin U receptor 2 (NMUR2) is a high-affinity receptor for NMU found in discrete regions of the central nervous system, in particular the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), where it may be responsible for mediating the anorectic effects of NMU. We hypothesized that selective knock down of NMUR2 in the PVN of rats would increase their sensitivity to the reinforcing properties of food resulting in increased intake and preference for high-fat obesogenic food. To this end, we used viral-mediated RNAi to selectively knock down NMUR2 gene expression in the PVN. In rats fed a standard chow, NMUR2 knockdown produced no significant effect on food intake or body weight. However, when the same rats were fed a high-fat diet (45% fat), they consumed significantly more food, gained more body weight, and had increased feed efficiency relative to controls. Furthermore, NMUR2 knockdown rats demonstrated significantly greater binge-type food consumption of the high-fat diet and showed a greater preference for higher-fat food. These results demonstrate that NMUR2 signaling in the PVN regulates consumption and preference for high-fat foods without disrupting feeding behavior associated with non-obesogenic standard chow.","Neuromedin U receptor 2 knockdown in the paraventricular nucleus modifies behavioral responses to obesogenic high-fat food and leads to increased body weight.","Neuroscience","Benzon CR and Johnson SB and McCue DL and Li D and Green TA and Hommel JD","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-16 17:47:39,-1,2021-02-17 00:23:53,,,,,,,,

In comparison with cycling rats, lactating Long-Evans rats markedly increased saline intake whereas F344 rats exhibited only a modest increase. Lactating rats of both strains increased total fluid intake, but this increase was primarily from water in F344 rats and from saline in Long-Evans rats. It was concluded that the aversion to saline characteristic of nonreproducing adult F344 rats continues during lactation.

Litters were distributed in control non-deprived (CTL), DEP3, or DEP11 groups. In Experiment 1, within each litter, one male and one female were submitted to one of the following tests: novelty suppressed feeding (NSF), sucrose negative contrast test (SNCT), and forced swimming test (FST), between postnatal days 52 and 60. In Experiment 2, two males and two females per litter were exposed to the elevated plus maze and 1 h later, perfused for investigation of NPY-ir, on PND 52. The results showed that DEP3 rats displayed greater anxiety-like behavior in the NSF and EPM, compared to CTL and DEP11 counterparts. In the SNCT, DEP3 and DEP11 males showed less suppression of the lower sucrose concentration intake, whereas all females suppressed less than males. Both manipulated groups displayed more immobility in the FST, although this effect was greater in DEP3 than in DEP11 rats. NPY-ir was reduced in DEP3 and DEP11 males and females in the BLA, whereas in the dHPC, DEP3 males showed less NPY-ir than DEP11, which, in turn, presented less NPY-ir than CTL rats. Females showed less NPY-ir than males in both structures. Because the deprivation effects were more intense in DEP3 than in DEP11, in Experiment 3, the frequency of nursing posture, licking-grooming, and interaction with pups was assessed upon litter reunion with mothers. Mothers of DEP11 litters engaged more in anogenital licking than mothers of DEP3 litters. The present results indicate that maternal deprivation changed affective behavior with greater impact in the earlier age and reduced the expression of NPY in emotion-related brain areas.

Rats in 'proestrus' group (with elevated estrogen) had significantly reduced (57% decrease, p < 0.05) oral bioavailability of total genistein (aglycone + conjugates) than those in 'metoestrus' group (with basal level of estrogen). Female ovariectomized rats, due to lack of estrogen, showed oral bioavailability of total genistein similar to the 'metoestrus' group but higher (155% increase, p < 0.05) than the 'proestrus' group. On the basis of intestinal perfusion studies, the increased bioavailability was partially attributed to the higher (>100% increase, p < 0.05) hepatic disposition via glucuronidation and possibly more efficient enterohepatic recycling of genistein in the 'metoestrus' group. Furthermore, chronic exogenous supplementation of estradiol in ovariectomized rats significantly reduced (77%, p < 0.05) the oral bioavailability of total genistein, mostly via increased sulfation (>10-fold) in liver, to a level comparable to those in the 'proestrus' group. In conclusion, the oral bioavailability of total genistein was inversely proportional to elevated estrogen levels in female rats, which is partially mediated through the regulation of hepatic enzymes responsible disposition of genistein.","Effects of estrogen and estrus cycle on pharmacokinetics, absorption, and disposition of genistein in female Sprague-Dawley rats.","Journal of agricultural and food chemistry","Kulkarni KH and Yang Z and Niu T and Hu M","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 23:10:41,-1,2021-03-07 16:54:35,,,,,,,,

Rats that remained normodipsic after vNM ablation usually exhibited hyperdipsia if they were food-deprived overnight. The basis for the hyperdipsia produced by vNM ablation was not clear. The elevated water intakes appeared not to result from chronic urinary fluid losses, because hyperdipsic rats were able to concentrate their urine during the day, when they drank little. Moreover, the animals did not seem to be volume depleted; their plasma renin activities were not elevated, and they drank normally in association with meals. These and other findings suggest that vNM lesions damage neural substrates that control drinking behavior, and the hyperdipsia results from this rather than from physiological changes produced by the lesion.","Hyperdipsia in rats after electrolytic lesions of nucleus medianus.","The American journal of physiology","Gardiner TW and Stricker EM","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 14:33:53,-1,2021-03-07 16:54:55,,,,,,,,

To elucidate whether endogenous insulin is involved in the entraining mechanisms of peripheral clocks to RF, we examined the expression profiles of clock genes in peripheral tissues of mice with diabetes induced by streptozotocin (STZ). The circadian expressing genes (mPer1, mPer2, and BMAL1) underwent a phase-shift induced by RF in the heart, liver, and kidney of both diabetic and normal animals. However, the expression phase of mPer1 in these tissues of the diabetic mice significantly differed from those in the normal animals under RF. The expression phase of the circadian output gene, albumin D-site binding protein (DBP), was completely shifted by RF both in normal and in diabetic mice, suggesting that the endogenous insulin is not essential for the entrainment of peripheral clocks to feeding cycles in mice.","Gene- and tissue-specific alterations of circadian clock gene expression in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice under restricted feeding.","Biochemical and biophysical research communications","Oishi K and Kasamatsu M and Ishida N","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-26 14:39:10,-1,2021-03-07 16:55:07,,,,,,,,

Here, we directly tested the hypothesis that intragastric (IG) nutrient infusion can suppress motivation for food. In a series of experiments, IG sucrose infusion (15 kcal) significantly and reliably reduced operant responding for a sucrose reward on a progressive ratio (PR) schedule. Moreover, food deprivation for 24 h before the test session did not prevent the suppressive effect of nutrients. The suppressive effect of IG sucrose on fixed ratio 5 (FR5) operant responding was also assessed as a comparison. The effect of IG nutrients to reduce motivation was not limited to sucrose; IG Ensure infusion (9.3 kcal) also significantly reduced PR operant responding for sucrose pellets. To verify that these effects were not secondary to the osmotic challenge of concentrated nutrients, we tested IG infusion of noncaloric saline solutions equiosmolar to 40% sucrose or Ensure and found no effect. Finally, we focused on glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and cholecystokinin (CCK) as candidate mediators for the effect of IG nutrients. Pretreatment with exendin-9, a GLP-1 receptor antagonist, delivered intraperitoneally, significantly attenuated the ability of IG nutrients to suppress PR responding and breakpoint in males, but not in females, whereas pretreatment with devazepide, a CCKA receptor antagonist, failed to do so in both sexes.

Two new studies tested if macronutrient composition of a flavoured meal before the reinforcing fast influences this acquisition of anticipatory hunger/satiety in a smooth-brained mammal. In one study, female Sprague-Dawley rats were trained for 11 cycles of 4 days with experimental meals of either carbohydrate or protein flavoured with either grape or cherry, with one odour followed by a 3-h fast and the other by 10 h of food deprivation. Both nutrient groups acquired anticipatory hunger. Then that learnt increase in meal size started to extinguish the hunger-avoidance response to the longer fast. The other study tested if this finding extended to experimental meals that combined carbohydrate and protein, and had vanilla or chicken flavours, to fasts of 4 and 12 h and to male rats as well as females within a training period of 6 cycles of 4 days. Evidence of anticipatory hunger early in training was clear only in the males. The combined results from the two experiments indicate that either carbohydrate or protein is sufficient for negative reinforcement of flavour-specific anticipatory hunger when the shorter fast lasts for 3 h.

In Experiment 1, food-restricted rats kept under a photoperiod of 12 h light:12 h dark received 50% of previous ad libitum food 2 h after the onset of light. Their daily rhythm of pineal melatonin and rhythms of plasma melatonin and corticosterone were examined and compared to those of ad libitum control rats after 1 or 2 months of food restriction. A significant phase advance (about 2 h) was found for the pineal melatonin rhythm and for the daily onset of plasma melatonin. Timing of nocturnal peak of circulating corticosterone was unchanged, and a diurnal peak anticipated food presentation by about 2 h. In Experiment 2, effects of a timed caloric restriction under 12L:12D were studied on the expression of daily rhythms of body temperature and locomotor activity. To discriminate between the effects of timed meal feeding and those of the added caloric restriction, these rhythms were analyzed in food-restricted rats, as in Experiment 1, and were compared to those in sham-restricted rats, concomitantly fed twice more than food-restricted rats (i.e., a timed meal feeding without caloric restriction). Acrophase of the nocturnal peak of body temperature rhythm reached the greatest phase advance (7 h) in food-restricted rats, in which it was close to LD transition. The nocturnal component of locomotor activity rhythm also was markedly phase advanced (6 h) by caloric restriction, as indicated by wheel-running and general activity occurring form early afternoon to midnight. A smaller 4-h phase advance of the nocturnal peak of body temperature also was observed in sham-restricted rats, although the onset of locomotor activity rhythm apparently was unaffected by meal feeding and the end of activity rhythm was phase advanced by 2 h. These results indicate that timed caloric restriction is a potent phase-shifting agent that interacts with the LD cycle zeitgeber. This nonphotic stimulus phase advances melatonin, corticosterone, body temperature, and activity rhythms to different extents and thus suggests a change in the internal synchronization of the circadian system.","Phase-advanced daily rhythms of melatonin, body temperature, and locomotor activity in food-restricted rats fed during daytime.","Journal of biological rhythms","Challet E and Pevet P and Vivien-Roels B and Malan A","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-24 18:57:11,-1,2021-03-07 16:56:31,,,,,,,,

The choice to engage in voluntary physical activity is undertaken in relation to the selection of other alternatives, such as sedentary behaviors, drugs, or food intake. The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system plays a critical role in behavioral activation or exertion of effort, and DA antagonism or depletion induces anergia in effort-based decision-making tasks. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying the decision-making processes that establish preferences for sedentary vs. activity-based reinforcers. In the present work with male CD1 mice, we evaluated the effect of tetrabenazine (TBZ), a DA-depleting agent, on a three-choice T-maze task developed to assess preference between reinforcers with different behavioral activation requirements and sensory properties [i.e., a running wheel (RW) vs. sweet pellets or a neutral nonsocial odor]. We also studied the effects of TBZ on the forced swim test (FST), which measures climbing and swimming in a stressful setting, and on anxiety tests [dark-light (DL) box and elevated plus maze (EPM)]. In the three-choice task, TBZ reduced time running in the wheel but increased time spent consuming sucrose, thus indicating reduced activation but relatively intact sucrose reinforcement. The effect of TBZ was not mimicked by motivational manipulations that change the value of the reinforcers, such as making the RW aversive or harder to move, food-restricting the animals, inducing a binge-like eating pattern, or introducing social odors. In the FST, TBZ decreased time climbing (most active behavior) and increased immobility but did not affect anxiety in the DL or EPM. These results indicate that the three-choice T-maze task could be useful for assessing DA modulation of preferences for exercise based on activation and effort requirements, differentiating those effects from changes in preference produced by altering physical requirements, food restriction state, and stress during testing.","Preference for Exercise vs. More Sedentary Reinforcers: Validation of an Animal Model of Tetrabenazine-Induced Anergia.","Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience","Carratala-Ros C and Lopez-Cruz L and SanMiguel N and Ibanez-Marin P and Martinez-Verdu A and Salamone JD and Correa M","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 14:06:55,-1,2021-03-07 16:56:50,,,,,,,,

Treatment is challenging given limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying this type of disordered eating. The hypothesis that dysregulation of mesocortical dopaminergic and GABAergic systems underlie binge eating was tested. METHODS: Analysis of gene expression within the ventral tegmental area and its terminal mesocortical regions was examined in bingeing rats before and after bingeing occurred. In addition, alterations in binge-type behavior induced by pharmacological inactivation of subnuclei of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and by pharmacological activation and inhibition of cortical D1 and D2 receptors were examined. RESULTS: Correlative and functional evidence demonstrates dysregulated neurotransmitter processing by the PFC and ventral tegmental area, but not the amygdala or nucleus accumbens, in bingeing rats. Either GABAergic inactivation or D2-like receptor activation within the PFC increased consumption in bingeing rats, but not controls, suggesting that the PFC, and D2 receptors in particular, functions as a behavioral brake to limit bingeing. CONCLUSIONS: The act of bingeing resolved some gene expression differences that preceded binge onset, further suggesting that bingeing may partially serve to self-medicate a system driving this maladaptive behavior. However, the failure of bingeing to resolve other dopaminergic/GABAergic differences may render individuals vulnerable to future binge episodes.","Binge-type eating disrupts dopaminergic and GABAergic signaling in the prefrontal cortex and ventral tegmental area.","Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)","Corwin RL and Wojnicki FH and Zimmer DJ and Babbs RK and McGrath LE and Olivos DR and Mietlicki-Baase EG and Hayes MR","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 19:02:40,-1,2021-03-07 16:57:35,,,,,,,,

Food entrainment is independent of the suprachiasmatic nucleus and depends on food-entrainable oscillators (FEO). Restricted feeding schedules lead animals toward a catabolic state and to increase their food driven motivation, suggesting that in this process metabolic- and reward-related mechanisms are implicated. This study explored if motivation driven by a palatable meal is sufficient to produce food-entrainment. To address this question, we evaluated whether daily fixed access to a highly palatable meal entrained (PME) locomotor activity, serum glucose and free fatty acids concentrations in rats maintained without food deprivation. The entrained response of PME rats was compared with rats entrained to RFS. In a second experiment, we used c-Fos-IR to identify structures in the central nervous system involved with PME. Rats showed anticipatory activity to a daily palatable meal, with a lower intensity than rats entrained to RFS. Anticipatory activity persisted at least for four cycles after interrupting palatable meal, suggesting that this persistence depends on an endogenous oscillator. Glucose and free fatty acids were not entrained in PME rats. c-Fos expression in limbic system nuclei was in phase with PME time, but not in the hypothalamus. Results suggest 1) that food deprivation, i.e. a catabolic state is not necessary for the expression of anticipatory activity; 2) that an increase in the motivational state due to taste and/or nutritional contents of palatable meal is sufficient to entrain behavior; and 3) that structures in the limbic system are involved in this entrainment process. The present study indicates that metabolic and motivational mechanisms are involved in food entrainment, and suggests that the FEO may be a multi-oscillatory system distributed over different regulatory systems in the brain.","Entrainment by a palatable meal induces food-anticipatory activity and c-Fos expression in reward-related areas of the brain.","Neuroscience","Mendoza J and Angeles-Castellanos M and Escobar C","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc)",-1,,-1,2021-02-20 20:02:30,-1,2021-02-19 02:48:07,,,,,,,,

Chow/Palatable rats showed spontaneous and progressively increasing hypophagia and body weight loss when fed the regular chow diet, and excessive food intake and body weight gain when fed the palatable diet. Diet-cycled rats dramatically escalated the intake of the palatable diet during the first hour of renewed access (7.5-fold compared to controls), and after withdrawal, they showed compulsive eating and heightened risk-taking behavior. The inverse agonist of the CB1 receptor, SR141716 reduced the excessive intake of palatable food with higher potency and the body weight with greater efficacy in Chow/Palatable rats, compared to controls. Moreover, SR141716 reduced compulsive eating and risk-taking behavior in Chow/Palatable rats. Finally, consistent with the behavioral and pharmacological observations, withdrawal from the palatable diet decreased the gene expression of the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase in the ventromedial hypothalamus while increasing that of CB1 receptors in the dorsal striatum in Chow/Palatable rats, compared to controls.

Two-way ANOVA revealed significant increase in time spent seeking for chocolate. Frequency analysis of LFP power spectra revealed significant increases in delta and theta powers. Phase-amplitude analysis showed significant increase in maximal modulation index and decrease in frequency for phase of theta-high gamma coupling. Taken together, neural signaling in the hippocampus was sensitive to chocolate olfactory cue that might underlie learning process in response to repeated chocolate consumptions that primed intense food approaching behavior.

Previous studies have shown that increased negative feedback efficacy of estrogen on gonadotropin secretion may be responsible. The present study was designed to test the alternate hypothesis that caloric restriction alters the positive feedback efficacy of estrogen on gonadotropin secretion. Adult, cycling female rats were placed on reduced food intake (R) equal to 50% of that consumed by ad/libitum-fed controls (C). When R rats stopped cycling, both R and C rats were ovariectomized (OVX) and immediately implanted subcutaneously with a Silastic capsule containing 100 microg 17beta-estradiol (E2). Blood samples were obtained at 0900-1000 hr and 1600-1730 hr on Days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 after OVX and implantation. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and E2 were measured by radioimmunoassay in duplicate aliquots. Results indicate that underfed female rats retain the ability to respond to elevated estrogen levels with an afternoon surge of gonadotropin which is present for at least 14 days for LH. By contrast, FSH surges in R rats became progressively smaller and were no longer significant after Day 10. The present results also demonstrate that the response of R rats to elevated estrogen levels is significantly greater than that of C rats on Days 2-4 for FSH and 2-14 for LH. It is concluded that an inability to respond to elevated estrogen levels with an afternoon LH surge is not the cause of the cessation of normal estrous cycles. The progressive decrease in the afternoon surge of FSH may be, at least partly, responsible for the decreased follicular development observed in underfed rats. Possible explanations of the enhanced LH response to the positive feedback of estrogen are discussed.","Chronic underfeeding increases the positive feedback efficacy of estrogen on gonadotropin secretion.","Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

Access to sucrose led to overeating and excessive weight gain. These effects were more pronounced when the sucrose was available for the 24-hour period or during the dark. Limited access to sucrose produced a reversal of the rat's usual circadian pattern of feeding when the sucrose was available during the light and increased the rat's nocturnal hyperphagia when it was available during the dark. Sucrose intake and the proportion of calories taken from sucrose were higher in the 24-hour access group and the dark access group than the light access group.

Further, they suggest that central beta-EP may not fulfil an essential role in the control of body weight in the rat. Lesioned rats did, however, reveal a shift in the diurnal rhythmicity of FI and WI reflected in a reduction in the dark:light ratios of these. An alteration in the diurnal rhythmicity of sleeping and core temperature, but not locomotor activity, was also seen. The shifts in hypothalamic ir-beta-EP and ir-DYN (but no other tissue levels of any peptide) were correlated with the magnitude of the shifts in diurnal rhythmicity of ingestive behaviour. Moreover, lesions caudal to the MBH (not affecting hypothalamic ir-beta-EP or ir-DYN) or dexamethasone treatment (which affects pituitary pools of ir-beta-EP and ir-DYN) did not modify these rhythms. Thus, in these respects, the effects are 'particular' to MBH lesions modifying hypothalamic ir-beta-EP and ir-DYN. The data suggest that the MBH may play a role in the modulation of the diurnal scheduling of ingestive behaviour in the rat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","The role of the mediobasal arcuate hypothalamus in relation to opioid systems in the control of ingestive behaviour in the rat.","Brain research","Millan MJ and Millan MH and Reid LD and Herz A","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-15 15:40:04,-1,2021-01-29 22:28:07,,,,,,,,

The investigation of depression-relevant behaviors and physiological responses to environmental stressors in animal models of depression may provide valuable insight regarding these mechanisms. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of these experiments was to investigate the interactions among central 5-HT(1A) receptors, endocrine function, and behavior in an animal model of depression, chronic mild stress (CMS). METHODS: The current study examined behavioral responses to a pleasurable stimulus (sucrose), estrous cycle length (in female rats), and plasma hormone levels following systemic administration of a selective 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist [(+)8-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyl-2-aminotetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT); 40 mug/kg, s.c.; administered 15 min prior to sacrifice], in male and female rats exposed to 4 weeks of CMS. RESULTS: Four weeks of CMS produced a reduction in the intake of 1% sucrose (anhedonia), as well as attenuated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) responses to 8-OH-DPAT in both male and female rats (22 and 18% lower than the control groups, respectively). Corticosterone and oxytocin responses to 8-OH-DPAT were not altered by exposure to CMS. In female rats, CMS induced a lengthening of the estrous cycle by approximately 40%. CONCLUSIONS: CMS produces minor HPA disruptions along with behavioral disruptions. Alterations in 5-HT(1A) receptor function in specific populations of neurons in the central nervous system may be associated with the CMS model. The current findings contribute to our understanding of the relations that stress and neuroendocrine function have to depressive disorders.","Chronic mild stress induces behavioral and physiological changes, and may alter serotonin 1A receptor function, in male and cycling female rats.","Psychopharmacology","Grippo AJ and Sullivan NR and Damjanoska KJ and Crane JW and Carrasco GA and Shi J and Chen Z and Garcia F and Muma NA and Van de Kar LD","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 20:44:50,-1,2021-03-07 17:06:23,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that energy availability differentially affects the appetitive (motivation), consummatory (performance), and learned (rewarding) components of behavior. In Experiment 1, appetitive and consummatory aspects of sex behavior were dissociated in the majority of female Syrian hamsters restricted to 75% of their ad libitum food intake for between 8 and 11 days. Food restriction significantly inhibited vaginal scent marking, decreased the preference for spending time with male hamsters vs. spending time with food, and increased food hoarding with no significant effect on consummatory behaviors such as the incidence of lordosis or food intake. In Experiments 2 and 3, we attempted to use a similar level of food restriction to dissociate sexual appetite from sexual reward. In hamsters, formation of a conditioned place preference (CPP) for copulatory reward is reflected in increased nucleus accumbens (NAc) neural activation, measured as immunocytochemical staining for c-Fos, the protein product of the immediate-early gene, c-fos. In Experiment 2, neural activation increased 1h after copulation in the NAc, and did not differ significantly between 10-day food-restricted and ad libitum-fed females in any brain area examined. In Experiment 3, females were either food-restricted or fed ad libitum over 8-30 days of conditioning with copulatory stimuli. Food-restricted females showed significantly fewer appetitive behaviors, but no difference in formation of a CPP compared to females fed ad libitum. Together these data are consistent with the idea that mild levels of food restriction that inhibit appetitive behaviors fail to attenuate consummatory behaviors and the rewarding consequences of copulation. Thus, appetitive sex behaviors are, at least partially, neuroanatomically and behaviorally distinct from both consummatory behaviors and copulatory reward.","Food restriction dissociates sexual motivation, sexual performance, and the rewarding consequences of copulation in female Syrian hamsters.","Behavioural brain research","Klingerman CM and Patel A and Hedges VL and Meisel RL and Schneider JE","study with other mammals other than rat mice,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 23:14:55,-1,2021-03-07 17:06:44,,,,,,,,

In the second experiment rats were on 100% free-feeding and at 80% reduced body weight, both conditions either with or without the influence of a FT-1 min schedule.

In a further experiment using 1.3% AcH the self-injection rates of animals at 80% body weight with a FT-1 min schedule reveal that the time of day of testing may be an important variable for inducing AcH intake.

Changes in ionized Ca concentration (nM/s) of 2.5% myocardial homogenates that were attributable to the Ca-ATPase pump and Ca-release channel (CRC), respectively, of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) were depressed 41 and 85% by HCF from 61.6 +/- 9.4 and 24.7 +/- 3.3, to 36.1 +/- 2.8 and 3.6 +/- 2.9. Activity of the Ca-pump was restored after 3 days of refeeding, whereas the CRC remained 23% depressed (all p < 0.05). Additionally, the CRC activity was inhibited to a 3-fold greater extent than controls by HCF, but was disinhibited within one day of refeeding. The greater effect on CRC than Ca-pump activity resulted in net Ca-uptake being unaffected by HCF. In addition to depression of Ca-cycling, ATP sythetase and total ATPase activities (IU/g), respectively, were depressed 20 and 15% by HCF from 174 +/- 19 and 51.3 +/- 3.8 to 140 +/- 15 and 43.7 +/- 4.7, but were restored to control values within one day of refeeding.

While the role of oxytocin in pair bonding and reproduction has been extensively studied, sex differences in conditioned and unconditioned behavioral responses to oxytocin treatment have not been fully characterized. Here, we determined whether male and female rats would show similar dose response curves in response to acute oxytocin on measures of locomotor activity, sucrose seeking, and sucrose intake. Male and freely cycling female rats received vehicle or oxytocin (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3mg/kg, IP) injections before behavioral tests designed to assess general motor activity, as well as sucrose self-administration and seeking. Lower doses of oxytocin decreased motor activity in a novel environment in females relative to males. Likewise, lower doses of oxytocin in females decreased responding for sucrose during maintenance of sucrose self-administration and reinstatement to sucrose-conditioned cues. However, sucrose seeking in response to a sucrose prime was only decreased by the highest oxytocin dose in both sexes. In general, oxytocin had similar effects in both sexes. However, females were more sensitive to lower doses of oxytocin than males. These findings are consistent with the notion that oxytocin regulates many of the same behaviors in males and females, but that the effects are typically more profound in females. Therapeutic use of oxytocin should include sex as a factor in determining dose regimens.","Oxytocin differentially affects sucrose taking and seeking in male and female rats.","Behavioural brain research","Zhou L and Ghee SM and See RE and Reichel CM","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 19:40:13,-1,2021-03-07 17:08:04,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Adult male C57Bl6 mice were placed on a HFD (58% kcal fat) or ingredient-matched, low-fat diet (LFD; 11% kcal fat) for 6 weeks. At the end of diet-regimen mice were either maintained on their respective diets, or HFD and LFD were replaced with normal chow (withdrawal). Effort-based operant responding for sucrose and high-fat food rewards was measured along with basal and stress-induced corticosterone levels and anxiety (elevated-plus maze). Protein levels for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), corticosterone releasing factor type 1 receptor (CRF-R1), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), phospho-CREB (pCREB) and DeltaFosB (truncated splice variant of FosB) were assessed in the amygdala, nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) via western immunoblotting. RESULTS: Six weeks of HFD resulting in significant weight gain elicited sucrose anhedonia, anxiety-like behaviour and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis (HPA) hypersensitivity to stress. Withdrawal from HFD but not LFD-potentiated anxiety and basal corticosterone levels and enhanced motivation for sucrose and high-fat food rewards. Chronic high-fat feeding reduced CRF-R1 and increased BDNF and pCREB protein levels in the amygdala and reduced TH and increased DeltaFosB protein in NAc and VTA. Heightened palatable food reward in mice withdrawn from HFD coincided with increased BDNF protein levels in NAc and decreased TH and pCREB expression in the amygdala. CONCLUSION: Anhedonia, anxiety and sensitivity to stressors develops during the course of HFD and may have a key role in a vicious cycle that perpetuates high-fat feeding and the development of obesity. Removal of HFD enhances stress responses and heightens vulnerability for palatable foods by increasing food-motivated behaviour.

Moreover, hypothalamic endocannabinoids seem to be part of neural circuitry involved in the modulating effects of leptin on energy homeostasis. Therefore, alterations of the endocannabinoid system could be involved in the pathophysiology of eating disorders, where a deranged leptin signalling has been also reported. In order to verify this hypothesis, we measured plasma levels of AEA, 2-AG, and leptin in 15 women with anorexia nervosa (AN), 12 women with bulimia nervosa (BN), 11 women with binge-eating disorder (BED), and 15 healthy women. Plasma levels of AEA resulted significantly enhanced in both anorexic and BED women, but not in bulimic patients. No significant change occurred in the plasma levels of 2-AG in all the patients' groups. Moreover, circulating AEA levels were significantly and inversely correlated with plasma leptin concentrations in both healthy controls and anorexic women. These findings show for the first time a derangement in the production of the endogenous cannabinoid AEA in drug-free symptomatic women with AN or with BED.

The data presented here suggest, however, that estrogens influence body weight by at least two mechanisms, one of which is independent of changes in food intake. When female rats were ovariectomized (Ovx) and food intake was limited to preoperative levels, the Ovx animals nonetheless gained large amounts of body weight. Although Ovx rats gained more weight than controls on the same amount of food, during 33 hr of food deprivation Ovx and control animals lost body weight at the same rate, which indicates that the prefasting metabolic rates of the two groups were generally similar. Examination of recovery from food deprivation suggested that the rate of weight gain after Ovx was very gradual. During the first 40 days after surgery, the ano-nasal lengths of Ovx rats increased twice as fast as the ano-nasal lengths of the intact rats, which suggests a mechanism for the gradual increase in body weight induced by Ovx. The body weights of intact rats followed a regular 4-day cycle during ad lib feeding but when the estrus-associated decrease in food intake was prevented the cyclic body weight changes were dramatically altered. Thus estrogens appear to regulate body weight by at least two mechanisms: modulation of food intake (cycling females) and modulation of ano-nasal growth or other metabolic processes (Ovx females).","Estrus- and ovariectomy-induced body weight changes: evidence for two estrogenic mechanisms.","Journal of comparative and physiological psychology","Mueller K and Hsiao S","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 22:58:02,-1,2021-03-07 17:08:50,,,,,,,,

The proposal is made that, due to several metabolic alterations which favor lipid deposition, the genetically obese Zucker rat (fafa) may be an appropriate model in which to study feeding-adipose tissue relationships. Data from several studies are presented demonstrating that the developing male Zucker fatty rat displays hyperphagia during the growth period which reaches a peak, or 'break point,' and then declines such that intake of fatty and lean rats becomes comparable at approximately 20 weeks of age. Beyond week 20, cycles of hyperphagia of several weeks' duration can be detected in fatty rats. The above feeding changes are related to data showing that on a laboratory chow-type diet, adipocytes approach maximal size at 15-16 weeks in the fatty rat, while accelerated proliferation of adipocytes takes place following week 20. During growth, responding for food in an operant task by fatty rats varies in accord with the pattern of hyperphagia. Further studies in the fatty rat show that the duration and magnitude of developmental hyperphagia can be altered by manipulating the caloric density and macronutrient content of the diet, with fat containing diets leading to the earliest break point of developmental hyperphagia.

For example, food-deprived female Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) forego vaginal scent marking and lordosis (sex behaviors) in favor of foraging, hoarding, and eating food (ingestive behavior). Reproductive processes tend to be energetically costly, and individual survival requires homeostasis in metabolic energy. Thus, during energetic challenges, the chances of survival are enhanced by decreasing the energy expended on reproductive processes. The entire hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) system is inhibited by severe energetic challenges, but comparatively little is known about the effects of mild energetic challenges. We hypothesized that (1) a trade-off is made between sex and ingestive behavior even when the level of food restriction is insufficient to inhibit the HPG system; (2) mild energetic challenges force a trade-off between appetitive ingestive and sex behaviors, but not consummatory versions of the same behaviors; and (3) the trade-off is orchestrated by ovarian steroid modulation of RFamide-related peptide 3 (RFRP-3). In other species, RFRP-3, an ortholog of avian gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone, is implicated in control of behavior in response to energetic challenges and stressful stimuli. In support of our three hypotheses, there is a 'dose-response' effect of food restriction and re-feeding on the activation of RFRP-3-immunoreactive cells in the dorsomedial hypothalamus and on appetitive behaviors (food hoarding and sexual motivation), but not on consummatory behaviors (food intake and lordosis), with no significant effect on circulating levels of estradiol or progesterone. The effect of food restriction on the activation of RFRP-3 cells is modulated at the time of estrus in gonadally-intact females and in ovariectomized females treated with progesterone alone or with estradiol plus progesterone. Intracerebral treatment with RFRP-3 results in significant decreases in sexual motivation and results in significant but small increases in food hoarding in hamsters fed ad libitum. These and other results are consistent with the idea that ovarian steroids and RFRP-3 are part of a system that orchestrates trade-offs in appetitive behaviors in environments where energy availability fluctuates.","RFamide-related Peptide-3 and the Trade-off between Reproductive and Ingestive Behavior.","Integrative and comparative biology","Schneider JE and Benton NA and Russo KA and Klingerman CM and Williams WP 3rd and Simberlund J and Abdulhay A and Brozek JM and Kriegsfeld LJ","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-27 21:10:02,-1,2021-03-12 00:59:50,,,,,,,,

However, few mouse models are available to examine the interaction between neural and genetic underpinnings of bingeing. In the present study, we first aim to establish a simple mouse model of binge-like sucrose overconsumption using daytime limited access training in food-restricted male mice. Trained mice received 4-h limited access to both 0.5M sucrose solution and chow for 10 days. Three control groups received (1) 4-h sucrose and 20-h chow access, (2) 20-h sucrose and 4-h, or (3) 20-h chow access, respectively. Only the trained group showed progressively increased sucrose consumption during brief periods of time and developed binge-like excessive behavior. Next, we examined whether the present mouse model mimicked a human feature of binge eating known as 'eating when not physically hungry.' Trained mice consumed significantly more sucrose or non-caloric sweetener (saccharin) during post-training days even after they nocturnally consumed substantial chow prior to daytime sweetener access. In other trained groups, both a systemic administration of glucose and substantial chow consumption prior to the daytime limited sucrose access failed to reduce binge-like sucrose overconsumption. Our results suggest that even when caloric consumption is not necessarily required, limited access training shapes and triggers binge-like overconsumption of sweetened solution in trained mice. The binge-like behavior in trained mice may be mainly due to enhanced hedonic motivation for the sweetener's taste. The present study suggests that our mouse model for binge-like sugar overconsumption may mimic some human features of binge eating and can be used to investigate the roles of neural and genetic mechanisms in binge-like overconsumption of sweetened substances in the absence of physical hunger.","A mouse model for binge-like sucrose overconsumption: Contribution of enhanced motivation for sweetener consumption.","Physiology & behavior","Yasoshima Y and Shimura T","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",1,2021-03-18 21:59:30,1,2021-02-20 20:10:51,-1,2021-03-07 17:10:05,,,,,,,,

In this study, performance under progressive ratio one (PR1) and three (PR3) schedules of shortening (fat) reinforcement was assessed in non-food deprived rats (n=15/group). One group of rats had intermittent access to a dietary fat option (INT, 1-hour shortening access in the home cage each Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), whereas the other group had daily access to the fat option (D, 1-hour shortening access daily). Chow and water were continuously available. After five weeks, the INT group consumed more shortening during the 1-hour access period than did the D group. Rats were then trained to lever press for a solid shortening reinforcer (0.1 gm). INT rats earned significantly more reinforcers than did D rats under PR1, but not under PR3. Subgroups of INT and D rats (n=7 each) were matched on the amount of shortening consumed in the home cage during week five of the protocol and the PR data were reanalyzed. The INT subgroup earned significantly more reinforcers than the D subgroup did under PR1, but not PR3.

The entrainment pathway(s) and location(s) of circadian oscillators driving these rhythms have not been definitively established. An important role for dopamine signaling and the dorsal striatum is suggested by a confluence of observations, including shifting of FAA rhythms by dopamine receptor agonists and attenuation by antagonists and D1 receptor knockout (D1R KO). The dopamine reward system exhibits sexual dimorphisms in structure and function; if FAA rhythms are regulated by this system, then FAA may also be sexually dimorphic. To assess this prediction, disk running and general activity were recorded continuously in male and female C57BL/6J mice with food available ad libitum and then restricted to a 4-hr daily meal in the middle of the light period. Compared with male mice, FAA in female mice was significantly reduced in duration, total count, peak level, and ratio relative to nocturnal activity. To determine whether these differences were mediated by D1 receptors, male and female homozygous D1R KO mice were examined. Compared with wild type and heterozygous mice, female and male D1R KO mice exhibited a marked attenuation of FAA parameters. The magnitude of the attenuation was greater in female mice. These results confirm an important role for dopamine D1 receptors in the circadian mechanism by which mice anticipate a daily meal, and they reveal a previously unreported sexual dimorphism in the expression of food-anticipatory rhythms that is amplified by D1R KO.","A sex difference in circadian food-anticipatory rhythms in mice: Interaction with dopamine D1 receptor knockout.","Behavioral neuroscience","Michalik M and Steele AD and Mistlberger RE","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc),no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-27 21:10:55,-1,2021-03-12 01:00:45,,,,,,,,

This disorder tends to first appear in late adolescence or young adulthood and is more common in women than men. While some animal models of BED have recapitulated both the overeating and the excessive body weight / fat of BED, very few have examined the motivational aspects of this disorder or utilized young females as subjects. In the present study, female Long-Evans rats, starting in late adolescence, were trained in operant chambers to self-administer the highly palatable Milk Chocolate Ensure Plus(R), in 30-minute ('short access') or 6-hour ('long access') sessions, 5 days per week, over 6.5 weeks. For comparison, other subjects were provided with Ensure ad libitum or maintained on chow and water only. Both short and long access to Ensure led rats to develop binge-type eating, measured as greater 30-minute caloric intake than rats with ad libitum or chow access and as increasing 30-minute intake across weeks. Compared to those with short access, rats with long access demonstrated moderately increased motivation for Ensure (measured by progressive ratio testing) and, compared to those with only chow access, they eventually showed significant hyperphagia on Ensure access days and hypophagia on non-access days. Rats with long access also showed greater body weight/fat than those maintained on chow. These findings suggest that, while both short and long operant access to Ensure causes young female rats to meet the definition of binge-type eating, they lead to different phenotypes of this behavior, with long access promoting the development of a greater number of features found in clinical BED. Ultimately, both models may be useful in future studies aimed at identifying the neurobiological basis of binge eating.","Short- and long-access palatable food self-administration results in different phenotypes of binge-type eating.","Physiology & behavior","Curtis GR and Coudriet JM and Sanzalone L and Mack NR and Stein LM and Hayes MR and Barson JR","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",1,2021-03-18 22:02:13,1,2021-02-20 20:19:00,-1,2021-03-07 17:17:15,,,,,,,,

In Experiment 1, the rats were initially exposed to a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle under ad-libitum feeding and were then subjected to either a phase-advance or phase-delay shift of 6 h. After the phase-advance shift, neither strain adapted; however, after the phase-delay shift, both strains adapted rapidly. In Experiment 2, the animals were subjected to either a nocturnal or a diurnal restricted-feeding paradigm and were then exposed to either a phase-advance or phase-delay shift with synchronized feeding. In the nocturnal restricted-feeding paradigms, both strains rapidly adapted to both shifts. Concerning diurnal restricted-feeding, DI animals readily entrained to the presentation of food in both shifts; whereas, LE animals exhibited a confused rhythmicity. In Experiment 3, animals were subjected to a phase-advance shift, while the time of feeding was held constant. Following the shift, LE animals responded to the onset of the dark at the new time; yet, were still influenced by the presentation of food. The DI animals maintained the preshift circadian pattern and continued to be dominated by the presentation of food. These experiments indicate that circadian rhythms of LE animals are dominated by the light entrainable oscillator (LEO) in ad-libitum feeding and by both the LEO and food entrainable oscillator (FEO) in restricted-feeding. On the other hand, the circadian rhythms of DI animals are dominated by the FEO unless food is provided ad-libitum.

However, preference for the vanillin-citral flavor was decreased in rats exposed to a mixture of this flavor and oil while they were food deprived.

In addition, leptin may serve as a mediator of the neuroendocrine response to starvation, and may modulate the stress response and the timing of puberty. A role for leptin in development is suggested by the presence of neuroendocrine and structural neuronal abnormalities in ob/ob mice with genetic leptin deficiency. Here, we sought to determine the ontogeny of leptin expression and its relationship to the developing neuroendocrine axis. Leptin increased 5-10-fold in female mice during the second postnatal week independent of fat mass, and declined after weaning. The rise in leptin preceded the establishment of adult levels of corticosterone, thyroxine, and estradiol. In contrast to adult mice, leptin was not acutely regulated by food deprivation during the early postnatal period. Circadian rhythms of leptin, corticosterone, and thyroxine were regulated by food intake in adult mice. When ad libitum feeding was restricted to the light cycle, peak corticosterone levels were shifted to the beginning of the light cycle and coincided with the nadir of leptin. The inverse relationship between leptin and corticosterone was maintained such that a rise in leptin after feeding was associated with a decline in corticosterone. To determine whether changes in corticosterone during food restriction are mediated by leptin, we compared the patterns of corticosterone levels among ob/ob, db/db, and lean mice. Despite their higher basal levels of corticosterone, leptin deficiency in ob/ ob mice did not prevent the nocturnal rise in corticosterone. In contrast, the nocturnal surge of corticosterone was blunted in db/db mice. Therefore, it is likely that factors in addition to leptin are involved in the regulation of the circadian rhythm of corticosterone. The temporal relationship between leptin and other hormones in neonatal and adult mice suggests that leptin is involved in the maturation and function of the neuroendocrine axis.","Postnatal leptin surge and regulation of circadian rhythm of leptin by feeding.

Estrogen receptors, mainly ERbeta type, are commonly found in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) neurons, an important nucleus related to anxiety modulation and the primary source of serotonin (5-HT) in the brain. Taking together, these findings suggest an involvement of estrogen in anxiety modulation during food restriction, possibly mediated by ERbeta activation in serotonergic DRN neurons. Thus, the present study investigated the relationship between food restriction and anxiety-like behavior, and the involvement of DRN and ERbeta on the modulation of anxiety-like behaviors in animals subjected to FR. For that, female Fischer rats were grouped in control group, with free access to food, or a FR group, which received 40% of control intake during 14 days. Animals were randomly treated with 17beta-estradiol (E2), DPN (ERbeta selective agonist), or their respective vehicles, PBS and DMSO. Behavioral tests were performed on Elevated T-Maze (ETM) and Open Field (OF). Our results suggest that FR probably reduced the estrogen levels, since the remained in the non-ovulatory cycle phases, and their uterine weight was lower when compared to control group. The FR rats showed increased inhibitory avoidance latency in theETM indicating that FR is associated with the development of an anxiety-like state. The injections of both E2 and DPN into DRN of FR animals had an anxiolytic effect. Those data suggest thatanxiety-like behavior induced by FR could be mediated by a reduction of ERbeta activation in the DRN neurons, probably due to decreased estrogen levels.","Estrogen receptor beta activation within dorsal raphe nucleus reverses anxiety-like behavior induced by food restriction in female rats.","Behavioural brain research","Campos GV and de Noronha SR and de Souza AA and Lima PM and Abreu AR and Chianca-Jr D and de Menezes RC","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc),no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 14:10:26,-1,2021-03-07 17:19:49,,,,,,,,

We tested if we could replicate metabolic and cognitive consequences of shiftwork, as reported in humans, in a rat model comparable to 5 wks of non-rotating night shifts. The following hypotheses were addressed: (i) shiftwork enhances body-weight gain, which would indicate metabolic effects; and (ii) shiftwork negatively affects learning of a simple goal-directed behavior, i.e., the association of lever pressing with food reward (instrumental learning), which would indicate cognitive effects. We used a novel method of forced locomotion to model work during the animals' normal resting period. We first show that Wistar rats, indeed, are active throughout a shiftwork protocol. In contrast with previous findings, the shiftwork protocol attenuated the normal weight gain to 76 +/- 8 g in 5 wks as compared to 123 +/- 15 g in the control group. The discrepancy with previous work may be explained by the concurrent observation that with our shiftwork protocol rats did not adjust their between-work circadian activity pattern. They maintained a normal level of activity during the 'off-work' periods. In the control experiment, rats were kept active during the dark period, normally dominated by activity. This demonstrated that forced activity, per se, did not affect body-weight gain (mean +/- SEM: 85 +/- 11 g over 5 wks as compared to 84 +/- 11 g in the control group). Rats were trained on an instrumental learning paradigm during the fifth week of the protocol. All groups showed equivalent increases in lever pressing from the first (3.8 +/- .7) to the sixth (21.3 +/- 2.4) session, and needed a similar amount of sessions (5.1 +/- .3) to reach a learning criterion (>/= 27 out of 30 lever presses).

We developed a model of binge eating proneness based on individual sensitivity of young female Sprague Dawley rats to significantly increase sucrose consumption in response to stress. The rats were subjected to unpredictable intermittent 1-h access to 10% sucrose. After the stabilization of sucrose intake, rats were assessed for consistency of higher (for binge-like eating prone, BEP) or lower (for binge-like eating resistant, BER) sucrose intake in response to unpredictable episodes of foot-shock stress. The objectives of this study included demonstrating face validity of the BEP model and determining if some of the features of this model were pre-existing before exposure to intermittent access to sucrose and repeated stress. The BEP rats consumed a larger (20%>BER) amount of sucrose in a discrete (1-h) period of time compared to the BER phenotype in non-stressful conditions and significantly increased sucrose intake (50%>BER) under stress. Conversely, stress did not affect sucrose intake in BER rats. BEP rats showed higher sucrose intake compared to BER rats at the beginning of darkness as well as during the light period when they were sated and not physically hungry. Analyses of the sucrose licking microstructure revealed that BEP rats had a high motivational drive to consume sucrose in non-stressful condition and an increased hedonic value of sucrose when they were exposed to stressful conditions. BEP rats consumed sucrose much more rapidly under stressful conditions compared to BER rats. Finally, BEP rats demonstrated compulsive-like intake of sucrose (assessed in the light-dark box) and a blunted stress-induced increase in plasma corticosterone levels. Body weight and chow intake were not different between the phenotypes. Before exposure to intermittent access to sucrose and repeated stress, the BEP rats showed no clear evidence for compulsive sucrose intake. However, from the first 1-h access to sucrose, the BEP rats exhibited sucrose overeating; and from the first exposure to stress before intermittent access to sucrose, the BEP rats showed a blunted increase in corticosterone plasma levels. Innate sucrose hyperconsumption and altered reactivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis to stress may be involved in the development of binge-like eating. Increased perceived hedonic value of palatable food and an increased motivation to consume this food despite aversive conditions as well as deregulated reactivity of the HPA axis may contribute to stress-induced bingeing on sucrose in BEP rats.","Behavioral and hormonal responses to stress in binge-like eating prone female rats.","Physiology & behavior","Calvez J and Timofeeva E","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-20 20:18:20,-1,2021-03-07 17:22:16,,,,,,,,

One of the main problems with behavioral tasks that use food for reinforcement is the requirement that the animal be food deprived. This manipulation could be problematic in studies using female animals, since it may interfere with the estrous cycle of the animals. The purpose of the present study was to investigate: (1) the effect of mild food deprivation on four different strains of rats, (2) factors in the food deprivation procedure that could affect the estrous cycle, and (3) the possible effect of enriched diets during food deprivation on the estrous cycle. A comparison of the estrous cycle in four different rat strains revealed differences in the reliability of the estrous cycle even before the onset of food deprivation. Fischer, Long-Evans, and Sprague-Dawley rats all showed reliable cycle patterns. This was not the case for Brown Norway rats. During food deprivation, the cycle of the Fischer rats was disrupted, whereas the Long-Evans and Sprague-Dawley animals continued to cycle. Both the rate of weight loss and the percent of ad libitum body weight were related to cessation of the estrous cycle. However, enriching an animal's diet with sugar or oil additives delayed the disruption of the estrous cycle. Additionally, animals resumed cycling when returned to ad libitum weight levels. The present findings suggest that when animals need to be food deprived, preference should be given to using Long-Evans or Sprague-Dawley rats. If Fischer rats must be used, they should not be deprived below 90-95% of their ad libitum body weight.

Binge eating is a highly heritable trait associated with eating disorders that is comorbid with mood and substance use disorders. Therefore, understanding its genetic basis will inform therapeutic development that could improve several comorbid neuropsychiatric conditions. METHODS: We assessed binge eating in closely related C57BL/6 mouse substrains and in an F2 cross to identify quantitative trait loci associated with binge eating. We used gene targeting to validate candidate genetic factors. Finally, we used transcriptome analysis of the striatum via messenger RNA sequencing to identify the premorbid transcriptome and the binge-induced transcriptome to inform molecular mechanisms mediating binge eating susceptibility and establishment. RESULTS: C57BL/6NJ but not C57BL/6J mice showed rapid and robust escalation in palatable food consumption. We mapped a single genome-wide significant quantitative trait locus on chromosome 11 (logarithm of the odds = 7.4) to a missense mutation in cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 2 (Cyfip2). We validated Cyfip2 as a major genetic factor underlying binge eating in heterozygous knockout mice on a C57BL/6N background that showed reduced binge eating toward a wild-type C57BL/6J-like level. Transcriptome analysis of premorbid genetic risk identified the enrichment terms morphine addiction and retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, whereas binge eating resulted in the downregulation of a gene set enriched for decreased myelination, oligodendrocyte differentiation, and expression.

Diets high in fat and sugar, however, may affect the day-night feeding rhythm resulting in a higher light phase intake. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that nutrients affect clock-gene expression. We therefore hypothesized that overconsuming fat and sugar alters clock-gene expression in brain structures important for feeding behavior. We determined the effects of a free-choice high-fat high-sugar (fcHFHS) diet on clock-gene expression in rat brain areas related to feeding and reward and compared them with chow-fed rats. Consuming a fcHFHS diet for 6 weeks disrupted day-night differences in Per2 mRNA expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and lateral hypothalamus but not in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, habenula, and ventral tegmental area. Furthermore, short-term sugar drinking, but not fat feeding, upregulates Per2 mRNA expression in the NAc. The disruptions in day-night differences in NAc Per2 gene expression were not accompanied by altered day-night differences in the mRNA expression of peptides related to food intake. We conclude that the fcHFHS diet and acute sugar drinking affect Per2 gene expression in areas involved in food reward; however, this is not sufficient to alter the day-night pattern of food intake.","A Free-Choice High-Fat High-Sugar Diet Alters Day-Night Per2 Gene Expression in Reward-Related Brain Areas in Rats.","Frontiers in endocrinology","Blancas-Velazquez AS and Unmehopa UA and Eggels L and Koekkoek L and Kalsbeek A and Mendoza J and la Fleur SE","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,2021-03-18 22:04:22,0,2021-02-23 22:45:19,-1,2021-03-07 17:23:41,,,,,,,,

Here we studied the physiological means used by golden spiny mice for conserving energy during food restriction and refeeding and the mechanism by which food consumption may influence thermoregulatory mechanisms and metabolic rate. As comparison, we studied the response to food restriction of another rocky desert rodent, Wagner's gerbil, which accumulates large seed caches. Ten out of 12 food-restricted spiny mice (resistant) were able to defend their body mass after an initial decrease, as opposed to Wagner's gerbils (n = 6). Two of the spiny mice (nonresistant) kept losing weight, and their food restriction was halted. In four resistant and two nonresistant spiny mice, we measured heart rate, body temperature, and oxygen consumption during food restriction. The resistant spiny mice significantly (P < 0.05) reduced energy expenditure and entered daily torpor. The nonresistant spiny mice did not reduce their energy expenditure. The gerbils' response to food restriction was similar to that of the nonresistant spiny mice. Resistant spiny mice leptin levels dropped significantly (n = 6, P < 0.05) after 24 h of food restriction, and continued to decrease throughout food restriction, as did body fat. During refeeding, although the golden spiny mice gained fat, leptin levels were not correlated with body mass (r(2) = 0.014). It is possible that this low correlation allows them to continue eating and accumulate fat when food is plentiful.","Defending body mass during food restriction in Acomys russatus: a desert rodent that does not store food.","American journal of physiology.

In humans, computerised operant conflict tests have identified response choice, latency, and vigour as distinct behavioural components. Animal operant conflict tests for measurement of these components would facilitate translational study. OBJECTIVES: In C57BL/6 mice, two operant conflict tests for measurement of response choice, latency, and vigour were established, and effects of chlordiazepoxide (CDZ) thereon investigated. METHODS: Mice were moderately diet-restricted to increase sucrose reward salience. A 1-lever test required responding under medium-effort reward/threat conditions of variable ratio 2-10 resulting in sucrose at p = 0.7 and footshock at p = 0.3. A 2-lever test mandated a choice between low-effort reward/threat with a fixed-ratio (FR) 2 lever yielding sucrose at p = 0.7 and footshock at p = 0.3 versus high-effort reward/no threat with a FR 20 lever yielding sucrose at p = 1. RESULTS: In the 1-lever test, CDZ (7.5 or 15 mg/kg i.p.) reduced post-trial pause (response latency) following either sucrose or footshock and reduced inter-response interval (increased response vigour) after footshock. In the 2-lever test, mice favoured the FR2 lever and particularly at post-reward trials. CDZ increased choice of FR2 and FR20 responding after footshock, reduced response latency overall, and increased response vigour at the FR2 lever and after footshock specifically. CONCLUSIONS: Mouse operant conflict tests, especially 2-lever choice, allow for the translational study of distinct anxiety components. CDZ influences each component by ameliorating the impact of both previous punishment and potential future punishment.","Establishing operant conflict tests for the translational study of anxiety in mice.","Psychopharmacology","Oberrauch S and Sigrist H and Sautter E and Gerster S and Bach DR and Pryce CR","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 18:47:25,-1,2021-03-07 17:24:38,,,,,,,,

Although dieted rats weighted less than nondieted high-fat fed controls at the completion of the sixth cycle, body composition analysis revealed that the two groups were equally obese. Cumulative caloric intake was less in dieted rats, suggesting that the pattern of consumption promoted by dieting helped to establish the obesity. Resting metabolic rate did not differ between the two groups.

Such treatment also suppresses food intake, which is reversed in male rats by reducing brain histamine levels prior to 2DG treatment. We, therefore, determined if 2DG extends estrous cycles in the female rat and if this is due to elevated brain histamine levels. We measured estrous cycle length during 2DG-induced glucoprivation, in the presence and absence of alpha-fluoromethylhistidine (FMH), a treatment that reduces brain histamine levels. Adult female rats were treated for 72 h with either saline (n = 8), 2DG (200 mg/kg S.C. every 6 h; n = 9), or FMH (100 mg/kg i.p. daily) + 2DG (200 mg/kg; n = 7). An additional group was treated with FMH (100 mg/kg i.p.; n = 5) alone. To determine if 2DG extends estrous cycles due to glucoprivation or to decreased caloric intake, a group of rats (n = 7) received a reduced diet equal to the mean daily food intake of rats receiving 2DG alone. 2DG induced more long estrous cycles compared to rats receiving saline, FMH + 2DG, or FMH alone. In rats treated with FMH + 2DG, the percentage of 4-5-day cycles was similar to that of saline-treated rats, and a high percentage of 4-5-day cycles was also observed in rats receiving a reduced diet. These data suggest that 2DG does not suppress estrous cycles through a decrease in total calorie intake, but rather by inducing glucoprivation. In addition, during 2DG-induced glucoprivation, elevated brain histamine levels contribute to the mechanism that suppresses reproductive function.","Glucoprivic regulation of estrous cycles in the rat.","Hormones and behavior","I'Anson H and Starer CA and Bonnema KR","drug, optogenetic or comoribities at the time of intermittent protocol,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-26 14:23:55,-1,2021-03-07 17:25:24,,,,,,,,

The present study was designed to examine time-place learning and to identify exogenous and endogenous factors that may affect this behavior in rats. In an initial experiment, rats displayed poor time-place behavior and appeared to prefer the feeder that was closer to the center aisle and water supply. When these cues were minimized in a subsequent experiment, rats consistently displayed the time-place discrimination by exhibiting food anticipatory activity (FAA) at the correct location prior to each meal time. These rats also showed significant correlations between the level of FAA and the amount of dopamine turnover (the dihydroxyphenylacetic acid/dopamine ratio) in the nucleus accumbens and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, indicating possible involvement of regional dopaminergic activity in time-place behavior. No correlation was found for norepinephrine, epinephrine, or serotonin. In addition, the correlation between FAA and dopamine turnover was not found when rats were entrained to only one meal per day. Together, the data suggest that rats can learn the time-place discrimination under proper experimental conditions and that dopamine may play a role in the expression of this behavior.","Behavioral and neurochemical investigation of circadian time-place learning in the rat.","Journal of biological rhythms","Aragona BJ and Curtis JT and Davidson AJ and Wang Z and Stephan FK","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 23:19:12,-1,2021-03-07 17:37:42,,,,,,,,

Reduced food intake also caused pronounced shifts in the temporal organization and amount of wheel-running activity in both animal models, albeit in a dichotomous fashion.

Rats were housed in an enclosed colony room and exposed to a regular light:dark cycle (light from 0700 to 1900 h). Available evidence indicates that reinforcer magnitude and time of day are related to arousal levels. As expected, a larger reinforcer magnitude led to a highly significant trial spacing effect. Evening training led to a higher response rate than morning training, but the trial-spacing effect was equally strong whether training was administered in the morning or in the evening.

Rats actively ingested 0.1 M sucrose solutions infused intraorally: (a) at a constant rate within sessions; and (b) during separate sessions across which the rate of intraoral infusion (= ingestion rate) was varied. Salient characteristics of 'intraoral intake' included: (1) covariation of swallow frequency and swallow volume to mediate adjustments in the rate of ingestion; (2) emission of rhythmic coupled movements (5-7 Hz) of the jaw and tongue that serve to transport fluid through the mouth; (3) a 20-40 ms increase in the duration of the rhythmic movement cycle associated with swallow onset; and (4) emergence of pauses between bursts of rhythmic oromotor behavior with increases in cumulative intake. That intraoral intake and fluid ingestion via spout-licking (Weijnen et al., Brain Behav. Evol., 25, 1985) share all of these features suggests strongly that common neural processes, relatively uninfluenced by sources of sensory feedback attending contact with an environmental fluid source, underlie these aspects of normal fluid ingestion.

Behavioral performance of rats was monitored by open field test, forced swim test, and sucrose consumption test. The expression of serotonin receptor-4 (Htr4) mRNA and Let-7a microRNA was detected by real-time PCR, while Htr4 protein level was measured by Western blot. RESULTS: In the open field test, rats subjected to MD and CUPS exhibited significant decreases in vertical activity. CUPS rats spent less time in the central area and excreted more fecal pellets than MD and control rats. In the forced swim and sucrose consumption tests, CUPS and MD rats exhibited significantly longer floating time and consumed less sucrose than control rats. MD rats exhibited significantly shorter floating time and consumed less sucrose than CUPS rats. MD rats showed significantly lower Htr4 mRNA and protein expression and significantly higher Let-7a level in the hippocampus than control rats. Htr4 mRNA and protein expression negatively correlated with Let-7a expression. Htr4 mRNA expression positively correlated with sucrose preference rate, while Let-7a expression negatively correlated with the sucrose preference rate.

Daytime feeding did not abolish the nocturnal activity rhythm, although total daily activity was reduced in these mice. Temporal expression of the circadian clock genes, Per2 and Rev-erbalpha, became synchronized to the feeding cycle in the liver, but not in skeletal muscle.

Plasma IGF-1 concentrations and Igf-1 expression in the livers and gastrocnemius muscles during the active phase were lower in DF, than in NF mice. Furthermore, exogenous IGF-1 injection significantly suppressed DF-induced reduction in gastrocnemius muscle mass, which might at least partly explain the association between decreased plasma IGF-1 concentrations and reductions in the skeletal muscle mass of DF mice.

The role of endocannabinoids in mammalian sexual behavior has been suggested because of the influence of cannabinoid receptor agonists and antagonists on rodent sexual activity. However, the involvement of endocannabinoids in human sexual behavior has not been studied. AIM: To investigate plasma endocannabinoid levels before and after masturbation in healthy male and female volunteers. OUTCOMES: Plasma levels of the endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), anandamide, the endocannabinoid-like lipids oleoyl ethanolamide and palmitoyl ethanolamide, arachidonic acid, and cortisol before and after masturbation to orgasm. METHODS: In study 1, endocannabinoid and cortisol levels were measured before and after masturbation to orgasm. In study 2, masturbation to orgasm was compared with a control condition using a single-blinded, randomized, 2-session crossover design. RESULTS: In study 1, masturbation to orgasm significantly increased plasma levels of the endocannabinoid 2-AG, whereas anandamide, oleoyl ethanolamide, palmitoyl ethanolamide, arachidonic acid, and cortisol levels were not altered. In study 2, only masturbation to orgasm, not the control condition, led to a significant increase in 2-AG levels. Interestingly, we also found a significant increase of oleoyl ethanolamide after masturbation to orgasm in study 2. CLINICAL TRANSLATION: Endocannabinoids might play an important role in the sexual response cycle, leading to possible implications for the understanding and treatment of sexual dysfunctions. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: We found an increase of 2-AG through masturbation to orgasm in 2 studies including a single-blinded randomized design. The exact role of endocannabinoid release as part of the sexual response cycle and the biological significance of the finding should be studied further. Cannabis and other drug use and the attainment of orgasm were self-reported in the present study. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that the endocannabinoid 2-AG is involved in the human sexual response cycle and we hypothesize that 2-AG release plays a role in the rewarding consequences of sexual arousal and orgasm.

Using two regimens of restricted nutrition (95 and 88% of ad libitum intake for 19 days), we have shown that moderately reduced food consumption can dramatically alter the number of endometrial macrophages and their immunoaccessory function in mice. Restricted nutrition also interfered with the estrous cycle, but the effects on endometrial macrophages were more extensive and qualitatively different than could be explained by diminished ovarian steroid hormone activity. Significantly less F4/80+ and Ia+ cells were found in the endometrium of food restricted mice than in ad libitum mice at the same estrous cycle stage. In the more severely restricted mice the losses were even greater than those seen after ovariectomy. In ad libitum fed animals, uterine but not peritoneal macrophages showed an ovarian hormone-dependent inhibitory phenotype in a splenocyte mitogenesis assay. Macrophages derived from both locations exhibited greater immunostimulatory activity following restricted nutrition. We conclude that endometrial macrophage populations are influenced by nutritional status and this may be mediated through both steroid hormone-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

Here, we modeled the roles of duration, intermittency and choice of access in bingeing, escalation of daily intake, and underacceptance of alternatives. METHOD: Female rats with ('Choice') or without continuous chow access, received chow or continuous (Chocolate), intermittent (MWF) long (24h, Int-Long), or intermittent short (30min, Int-Short) access to a sucrose-rich, chocolate-flavored diet (CHOC). RESULTS: Int-Long rats showed cycling body weight; they overate CHOC, had increased feed efficiency on access days and underate chow and lost weight on non-access days, the latter correlating with their reduced brown fat. Int-Short rats had the greatest 30-min intake upon CHOC access, but did not underaccept chow or weight cycle. Individual vulnerability for intermittent access-induced feeding adaptations was seen. Continuous access rats gained fat disproportionate, but in direct relation, to their normalized energy intake and persistently underaccepted chow despite abstinence and return to normal weight. Abstinence reduced the binge-like CHOC intake of Int-Short rats and increased that of continuous access rats, but not to levels associated with intermittent access history. Choice increased daily CHOC intake under Continuous access and binge-like intake under Int-Short access. CONCLUSIONS: Intermittency and duration of past access to palatable food have dissociable, individually-vulnerable influences on its intake and that of alternatives. With extended access, daily intake reflects the palatability of available food, rather than metabolic need. Ongoing restrictedness of access or a history of intermittency each drive binge-like intake.

While some rats can be classified as sucralose preferrers (SP), as they prefer sucralose across a broad range of concentrations, others can be classified as sucralose avoiders (SA), as they avoid sucralose at concentrations above 0.1 g/L. Here, we expand on a previous report of this phenomenon by demonstrating, in a series of 2-bottle 24-h preference tests involving water and an ascending series of sucralose concentrations, that this variability in sucralose preference is robust across sex, stage of the estrous cycle, and 2 rat strains (Long-Evans and Sprague-Dawley). In a second experiment involving a large sample of rats (n = 50), we established that the ratio of SP to SA is approximately 35-65%. This bimodal behavioral response to sucralose appears to be driven by taste because rats display a similar bimodal licking response to a range of sucralose solutions presented during brief-access tests. Finally, we have shown that sucralose avoidance is extremely robust as 23-h water-deprived SA continue to avoid sucralose in 1-h single-bottle intake tests. Based on their reduced licking responses to sucralose during brief-access (taste driven) tests, and the fact that their distaste for sucralose cannot be overcome by the motivation to rehydrate, we conclude that SA detect a negative taste quality of sucralose that SP are relatively insensitive to.","Rats display a robust bimodal preference profile for sucralose.","Chemical senses","Loney GC and Torregrossa AM and Smith JC and Sclafani A and Eckel LA","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 22:58:24,-1,2021-03-07 17:51:49,,,,,,,,

Male Wistar rats were allowed to lever press for heroin (60 microg/kg/0.1 ml infusion/s; fixed ratio 1; 20-s time out) and nosepoke for food and water in consecutive, daily 23-h sessions. Daily heroin intake increased over days, reaching significance by Day 14. Drug-taking increased across the circadian cycle, reflected as increases in both the nocturnal peak and diurnal nadir of heroin intake. Changes in the circadian pattern of food intake and meal patterning preceded and paralleled the changes in heroin intake. By Day 7, the circadian amplitude of feeding was blunted. Nocturnal intake decreased because rats consumed smaller and briefer meals. Diurnal intake increased due to increased meal frequency, whereas total daily food intake decreased. To control for time or experience in the self-administration boxes as a possible confound, rats with saline (no drug) tethers were tested and did not display significant changes in food intake pattern. Body weight gain slowed slightly in heroin rats relative to saline controls. Separate groups of rats revealed that significant physical dependence as measured by physical signs of opiate withdrawal following a naloxone injection (1.0 mg/kg, subcutaneous (s.c.)) was reached by Day 14. Significant increases in heroin intake could be produced using low doses of naloxone (0.003-0.03 mg/kg, s.c.) on days 28-31 of heroin access. After 6 weeks of heroin self-administration, rats injected with buprenorphine (0, 0.01, 0.04, and 0.2 mg/kg, s.c.) showed a dose-dependent reduction in heroin intake. Changes in the pattern of drug and food intake in the present unlimited heroin access model may serve as independent motivational markers for the transition to a drug-dependent state.","Unlimited access to heroin self-administration: independent motivational markers of opiate dependence.","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Chen SA and O'Dell LE and Hoefer ME and Greenwell TN and Zorrilla EP and Koob GF","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 19:09:37,-1,2021-03-07 17:51:59,,,,,,,,

Histamine was not differentially potent for drinking in the day or night phase of the diurnal cycle. Bilateral subdiaphragmatic vagotomy, with the hepatic branch left intact, severely attenuated drinking in response to systemic histamine: Vagotomized rats drank later and less than did normal rats after doses of histamine between 1.25 and 40 mg/kg. This attenuation was attributed to the destruction of vagal afferent fibers because histamine-elicited drinking was not affected by blockade of vagal efferents with the peripheral anticholinergic atropine methyl nitrate. Drugs antagonistic to peripheral H2 histamine receptors specifically inhibited drinking in response to histamine: Intraperitoneal cimetidine or metiamide delayed and decreased drinking after sc histamine and temporarily decreased drinking after hypovolemia produced by sc polyethylene glycol, but these H2 antagonists failed to inhibit drinking after water deprivation, cellular dehydration, or isoproterenol. Finally, cimetidine or metiamide inhibited drinking in temporal association with a meal of liquid or solid food without decreasing food intake.

It is believed that this type of learning is dependent upon the ability of animals to consult their internal circadian pacemakers entrained by various environmental zeitgebers, such as light-dark cycles and scheduled restricted feeding. In the present study, we examined, (1) whether rats can acquire time-of-day discrimination in an aversively motivated water maze task wherein an escape platform is located in one position in the morning and in another position in the afternoon; (2) whether time-of-day cues provided by the light- and feeding-entrainable pacemakers may have divergent impacts upon the ability of rats to learn this task. Two groups of rats, both maintained on 12-h light:12-h dark cycle, were used; in one group, animals had free access to food, whereas in the other, they were subjected to a restricted feeding protocol (60% of food consumed by rats fed ad libitum, once daily). Despite the heightened difficulty of the task, food-restricted rats were apparently able to acquire associations between two different platform positions and two different times of day, as indicated by the fact that the percentage of discrimination errors in this group declined progressively, as a function of training, and stabilized at the level of 22+/-9%. In contrast, rats that were fed ad libitum, even after extensive training, failed to perform the task above level of chance. These data indicate that time-place learning is a universal, reward-nonspecific, cognitive phenomenon. They furthermore suggest that the ability of animals to integrate spatial and temporal information can be dependent on the access to timing stimuli provided by the feeding-entrainable circadian system.","Restricted feeding facilitates time-place learning in adult rats.","Behavioural brain research","Lukoyanov NV and Pereira PA and Mesquita RM and Andrade JP","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,2021-03-18 22:14:04,1,2021-02-23 14:34:36,-1,2021-03-08 19:17:40,,,,,,,,

Food restriction to 70% of normal intake led to anticipatory components in some intact animals, without entraining the dominant circadian pacemaker. The combination of a palatable diet and food restriction led to anticipatory activity before the daily feeding times and entrainment of a previously free-running circadian rhythm in some animals. Ablation of the SCN did not eliminate anticipatory activity in experimental animals, but did eliminate the free-running component of the rhythms.

Energy homeostasis is achieved through neuroendocrine and metabolic control of energy intake, storage, and expenditure. Traditionally, these controls have been studied in an unrealistic and narrow context. The appetite for food, for example, is most often assumed to be independent of other motivations, such as sexual desire, fearfulness, and competition. Furthermore, our understanding of all aspects of energy homeostasis is based on studying males of only a few species. The baseline control subjects are most often housed in enclosed spaces, with continuous, unlimited access to food. In the last century, this approach has generated useful information, but all the while, the global prevalence of obesity has increased and remains at unprecedented levels (Ogden et al., 2013, 2014). It is likely, however, that the mechanisms that control ingestive behavior were molded by evolutionary forces, and that few, if any vertebrate species evolved in the presence of a limitless food supply, in an enclosed 0.5 x 1 ft space, and exposed to a constant ambient temperature of 22+2 degrees C. This special issue of Hormones and Behavior therefore contains 9 review articles and 7 data articles that consider energy homeostasis within the context of other motivations and physiological processes, such as early development, sexual differentiation, sexual motivation, reproduction, seasonality, hibernation, and migration. Each article is focused on a different species or on a set of species, and most vertebrate classes are represented. Energy homeostasis is viewed in the context of the selection pressures that simultaneously molded multiple aspects of energy intake, storage, and expenditure. This approach yields surprising conclusions regarding the function of those traits and their underlying neuroendocrine mechanisms.","Guest editor's introduction: Energy homeostasis in context.","Hormones and behavior","Schneider JE","non-experimental study,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 21:20:14,-1,2021-03-08 19:18:26,,,,,,,,

During refeeding animals were given 22.8 g/day of food so that they were offered, during the 24-day cycle, the same amount of food offered to control rats that were not subjected to weight cycling.

The other weight-cycled group (nibblers) was fed by automated feeders in several small meals during each 24-h period (i.e., prevented from gorging). Neither weight-cycled group displayed an increased food efficiency or an increased body fatness compared with noncycled controls. Weight-cycled rats allowed to gorge did have an increased food efficiency and a greater carcass energy content compared with weight-cycled rats not allowed to gorge.

This allows animals to anticipate which locations to visit or avoid based on previous experience and knowledge of the current time of day. The TPL task applied in this study consists of three daily sessions in a three-arm maze, with a food reward at the end of each arm. During each session, mice should avoid one specific arm to avoid a foot-shock. We previously demonstrated that, rather than using external cue-based strategies, mice use an internal clock (circadian strategy) for TPL, referred to as circadian TPL (cTPL). It is unknown in which brain region(s) or peripheral organ(s) the consulted clock underlying cTPL resides. Three candidates were examined in this study: (a) the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a light entrainable oscillator (LEO) and considered the master circadian clock in the brain, (b) the food entrainable oscillator (FEO), entrained by restricted food availability, and (c) the adrenal glands, harboring an important peripheral oscillator. cTPL performance should be affected if the underlying oscillator system is abruptly phase-shifted. Therefore, we first investigated cTPL sensitivity to abrupt light and food shifts. Next we investigated cTPL in SCN-lesioned- and adrenalectomized mice. Abrupt FEO phase-shifts (induced by advancing and delaying feeding time) affected TPL performance in specific test sessions while a LEO phase-shift (induced by a light pulse) more severely affected TPL performance in all three daily test sessions. SCN-lesioned mice showed no TPL deficiencies compared to SHAM-lesioned mice. Moreover, both SHAM- and SCN-lesioned mice showed unaffected cTPL performance when re-tested after bilateral adrenalectomy.

This approach is useful for understanding adaptations to natural variation in food availability. Earlier studies have shown that animals foraging on a fixed reward schedule decrease energy intake and expenditure. However, the extent to which these changes depend on decreased food intake or increased foraging costs per se has never been tested. We manipulated foraging costs per food reward in female Hsd:ICR(CD-1) laboratory mice, comparing animals faced with low (L) and high (H) foraging costs to non-foraging animals receiving a food restriction (R) matched to the intake of H animals. Mice in the H group ran as much as L mice did but ate significantly less. They concurrently reduced daily energy expenditure and resting metabolic rate, decreased the size of major metabolic organs and utilized body fat stores; mass-specific resting metabolic rate did not differ between groups. We found evidence that these alterations in energy balance may carry fitness costs. As a secondary response to our experimental treatment, H females and, eventually, some R females ceased to show signs of estrous cyclicity. Surprisingly, results of an immune challenge with keyhole limpet hemocyanin showed that primary immune response did not differ between L and H groups, and was actually higher in R mice.

Furthermore, optogenetic stimulation of VTA GABA neurons directly suppressed the activity and excitability of neighboring DA neurons as well as the release of DA in the NAc, suggesting that the dynamic interplay between VTA DA and GABA neurons can control the initiation and termination of reward-related behaviors.","Activation of VTA GABA neurons disrupts reward consumption.","Neuron","van Zessen R and Phillips JL and Budygin EA and Stuber GD","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 20:52:32,-1,2021-03-08 19:21:29,,,,,,,,

One factor thought to contribute to binge episodes is a high level of reactivity to food-associated cues (i.e., cue reactivity). The insula is a neural node poised to regulate both binge eating and cue reactivity because of its prominent role in interpretation of internal and external cues. This work established a positive association between high fat food (HFF) binge intake and cue reactivity in male rats. Furthermore, we demonstrated that activation of the anterior insula suppressed both HFF binge intake and cue reactivity, without altering homeostatic intake of food. We further show that attenuation of HFF binge intake and cue reactivity is not due to decreased food-reward efficacy or deficits in motivation. Together, these data establish a key role for the anterior insula in the control of binge eating related-behaviors and support novel avenues for the treatment of binge eating.","Anterior insula activity regulates the associated behaviors of high fat food binge intake and cue reactivity in male rats.","Appetite","Price AE and Stutz SJ and Hommel JD and Anastasio NC and Cunningham KA","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 19:00:23,-1,2021-03-08 19:22:03,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we assessed temporal variation in LG and ABN in lactating rats across the circadian cycle and determined the impact of these behaviors for the prediction of offspring hypothalamic gene expression, anxiety-like behavior, and responsiveness to a high fat diet (HFD). We find that distinguishing between dams that engage in stable individual differences in maternal behavior (Low, Mid, High) requires assessment across the light-dark phases of the light cycle and across multiple postpartum days. Among juvenile female offspring, we find a positive correlation between maternal LG and mRNA levels of estrogen receptor alpha and beta and the oxytocin receptor (when LG is assessed across the light-dark cycle or in the dark phase). In young adults, we find sex-specific effects, with female High LG offspring exhibiting increased exploration of a novel environment and increased latency to approach HFD, and male High LG offspring displaying increased activity in a novel environment and reduced HFD consumption. Importantly, these effects on behavior were primarily evident when LG was assessed across the light-dark cycle and ABN was not associated with these measures. Overall, our findings illustrate the dissociation between the effects of LG and ABN on offspring development and provide critical insights into the temporal characteristics of maternal behavior that have methodological implications for the study of maternal effects.","Implications of temporal variation in maternal care for the prediction of neurobiological and behavioral outcomes in offspring.","Behavioral neuroscience","Jensen Pena C and Champagne FA","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 23:17:03,-1,2021-03-08 19:22:57,,,,,,,,

During food deprivation, PS was depressed in the dark phase of the diurnal cycle and increased in the light phase. The sleep parameter that was most affected by food deprivation was the duration of sleep episodes. Episodes of slow-wave sleep (SWS) and PS were shortened only in the dark phase of the deprivation days, whereas total sleep episodes were progressively decreased in both diurnal phases. After restitution of food, the episodes of SWS and total sleep were immediately lengthened and tended to exceed the control level. The duration of feeding episodes and meal size were significantly increased in comparison to pre-deprivation values, whereas feeding frequency was decreased. Long episodes of continuous motor activity occurred during the dark phase of the refeeding period, while a fragmented activity pattern was typical for the deprivation nights.

The mesocorticolimbic reward circuit, including the nucleus accumbens and the medial prefrontal cortex, is likely involved because this circuit mediates the hedonic value and incentive salience of palatable foods (PF). Here we tested the hypothesis that higher propensity for binge eating is associated with a heightened response (i.e., Fos induction) of the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex to PF, using an animal model that identifies binge eating prone (BEP) and binge eating resistant (BER) rats. Forty adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were given intermittent access to PF (high fat pellets) 3x/week for 3 weeks. Based on a pattern of either consistently high or consistently low PF consumption across these feeding tests, 8 rats met criteria for categorization as BEP, and 11 rats met criteria for categorization as BER. One week after the final feeding test, BEP and BER rats were either exposed to PF in their home cages or were given no PF in their home cages for 1h prior to perfusion, leading to three experimental groups for the Fos analysis: BEPs given PF, BERs given PF, and a No PF control group. The total number of Fos-immunoreactive (Fos-ir) cells in the nucleus accumbens core and shell, and the cingulate, prelimbic, and infralimbic regions of the medial prefrontal cortex was estimated by stereological analysis. PF induced higher Fos expression in the nucleus accumbens shell and core and in the prelimbic and infralimbic cortex of BEP rats compared to No PF controls. Throughout the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex, PF induced higher Fos expression in BEP than in BER rats, even after adjusting for differences in PF intake. Differences in the neural activation pattern between BEP and BER rats were more robust in prefrontal cortex than in nucleus accumbens. These data confirm that PF activates brain regions responsible for encoding the incentive salience and hedonic properties of PF, and suggest that binge eating proneness is associated with enhanced responses to PF in brain regions that exert executive control over food reward.","Differential mesocorticolimbic responses to palatable food in binge eating prone and binge eating resistant female rats.","Physiology & behavior","Sinclair EB and Culbert KM and Gradl DR and Richardson KA and Klump KL and Sisk CL","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc),no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-20 20:14:25,-1,2021-03-08 19:23:56,,,,,,,,

In contrast, during the dark phase, 3.2mg/kg morphine produced comparable, moderately strong aversions in all strains.

We developed an animal model of binge eating in sated rats that is evoked by stress, but only in rats with a history of caloric restriction and only if highly palatable food (HPF) is available after stress. This study investigated the effect of known binge triggers, a taste of HPF and of hunger, on this type of binge eating. METHOD: Female rats were cycled through the R/S protocol but this time were given just a taste of HPF with ad lib regular chow. After another R/S cycle, rats were stressed during restriction (while hungry) and were given HPF and chow. RESULTS: Although binge eating did not occur if only chow was available after stress, just a taste of HPF sufficed to increase chow intake to more than 160% (p < 0.001) of rats with a history of restriction only, stress-only, or neither. Hunger increased the proportion of chow consumed by both restricted groups, but stress magnified this hunger-induced overeating by increasing HPF intake to 137% of restriction-only rats (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: These effects suggest that binge eating in this model is motivated by reward, not metabolic need, and parallels observations of binge triggers described in clinical binge-eating disorders. This strengthens the validity of using this animal model to target the physiology and treatment of eating disorders preceded by dieting and stress.","The role of palatable food and hunger as trigger factors in an animal model of stress induced binge eating.","The International journal of eating disorders","Hagan MM and Chandler PC and Wauford PK and Rybak RJ and Oswald KD","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-20 20:15:44,-1,2021-03-08 19:25:43,,,,,,,,

The effect of potato chips on energy intake in a snacking model could be explained by their fat/carbohydrate content (FCHc). The present study investigated if the FCHc shapes energy intake patterns and reward processing of satiated rodents. Modulation of energy intake patterns was studied in an established snacking model offering FCHc rich food for 3 x 10 min/day to satiated rats. Reward processing was analyzed by a previously established conditioned place preference tests in satiated mice. The limited access to FCHc rich food led to higher daily energy intake compared to days without access (110 +/- 10 vs. 96 +/- 5 kcal/day) indicating that fat/carbohydrate intake was not fully compensated by reducing standard chow intake during the rest of the day. Furthermore, fat/carbohydrate snacking led to binge eating episodes with up to 55% of the daily energy intake consumed during limited access. Forced withdrawal from fat/carbohydrate snacking opportunities for six weeks increased the total daily energy intake and the relative amount of energy consumed by FCHc after reintroducing fat/carbohydrate snacking. Snack food and fat/carbohydrate food were powerful food reinforcers in satiated mice in contrast to standard chow. Altogether, these data suggest that the FCHc of snack food has strong reinforcing properties, which are probably responsible for the significant modulation of the amount and pattern of food intake in ad libitum fed animals.","Influence of the fat/carbohydrate component of snack food on energy intake pattern and reinforcing properties in rodents.","Behavioural brain research","Hess A and Kress S and Rakete S and Muench G and Kornhuber J and Pischetsrieder M and Muller CP","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",1,2021-03-18 22:42:57,1,2021-02-16 17:59:34,-1,2021-02-17 00:35:10,,,,,,,,

Many antidotes to cyanide poisoning oxidize hemoglobin to methemoglobin (metHb), which serves as a scavenger of the cyanide anion. However, sufficiently high levels of metHb can be toxic because metHb cannot bind O(2) until it is reduced. The purpose of the proposed study was twofold: (1) Characterize the time course of metHb formation for different doses of p-aminopropiophenone (PAPP), a drug that oxidizes hemoglobin and can be used as an antidote to cyanide intoxication; and (2) Determine whether the effort of an operant response affects the behavioral toxicity of metHb, since more effortful responses presumably are more energetically demanding. In Experiment I, the oral metHb kinetics of p-aminopropiophenone (PAPP) were studied; four doses of PAPP (1, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) or the vehicle, polyethylene glycol 200 (PEG200), were delivered via a gavage tube to separate groups of rats. In Experiment II, rats were trained to press a lever or run in an activity wheel at any time during a 12-hour light/dark cycle for their entire daily food intake; five presses or turns were required for the delivery of each food pellet. The same doses of PAPP were delivered p.o. shortly before the onset of darkness, 2100 h. Results from Exp I showed that PAPP induced a dose-dependent rapid increase and relatively slower exponential-like decline in metHb concentration. In Exp. II, the same doses of PAPP induced a dose-dependent reduction in hourly outputs of leverpresses and wheelturns however; wheelturns were reduced significantly more than leverpresses. When the best-fitting metHb curves from Experiment I were superimposed on the time scale for outputs of wheelturns and leverpresses, reduction of output was inversely related to the kinetics of metHb formation. These findings are consistent with the conclusion that PAPP-induced metHb formation reduced the output of wheelrunning more than leverpressing because the more energetically demanding response of wheelrunning was more affected by metHb induced hypoxemia. Furthermore, these data suggest that although certain longacting metHb formers might be useful prophylactics for warfighters, it will be critical to determine the energetic loads of required battlefield activities because even low (10%) therapeutic metHb levels might impair the performance of those activities.","Operant leverpressing and wheelrunning were differentially reduced by PAPP (p-aminopropiophenone)-induced methemoglobinemia.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior","Bauman RA and Widholm JJ","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 23:12:38,-1,2021-03-08 19:26:20,,,,,,,,

Design: Participants performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging while exposed to visual food cues in four time points: fasting and fed conditions in midfollicular and midluteal phases. Patients: Twenty females with regular cycles and 12 on monophasic OCP, aged 18 to 35 years. Main Outcome Measures: Activity in homeostatic (hypothalamus), reward (amygdala, putamen and insula), frontal (anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and visual regions (calcarine and lateral occipital cortex). Setting: Tertiary hospital. Results: In females with regular cycles, brain regions associated with homeostasis but also the reward system, executive frontal areas, and afferent visual areas were activated to a greater degree during the luteal compared with the follicular phase. Within the visual areas, a dual effect of hormonal and prandial state was seen. In females on monophasic OCPs, characterized by a permanently elevated progesterone concentration, activity reminiscent of the luteal phase was found. Androgen, cortisol, testosterone, and insulin levels were significantly correlated with reward and visual region activation. Conclusions: Hormonal mechanisms affect the responses of women's homeostatic, emotional, and attentional brain regions to food cues.

The present study aimed first to determine whether corticolimbic structures participate in the expression of FAA, therefore c-Fos immunoreactivity (Fos-IR) was employed as marker of neuronal activity. The second goal was to characterize diurnal rhythms of the clock protein protein Per1 (PER1) in corticolimbic structures and to determine the influence of RFS on the diurnal temporal pattern. Rats were maintained under RFS with food access for 2 h daily, a control group was fed ad libitum. Food entrainment produced a pattern of increased Fos-IR during FAA and after mealtime in the two sub-regions of the nucleus accumbens (ACC), in the basolateral and central amygdala, in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), in the lateral septum (LS), in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT). No increased Fos-IR was observed in the hippocampus. Under ad libitum conditions all structures studied showed daily oscillations of PER1, excluding both amygdalar nuclei and the PFC. RFS shifted and set the daily peaks at zeitgeber time (ZT) 12 for both sub-regions in the accumbens, the hippocampus, lateral septum and PFC. RFS enhanced the amplitude at ZT12 of the BNST and shifted the peak of the PVT to ZT6. No changes were observed in the amygdalar nuclei. Present data indicate that cellular activation of corticolimbic structures is associated with behavioral events related to food anticipatory activity and that mealtime is a relevant signal that shifts daily oscillations of PER1 in corticolimbic structures.

After a 2-day placebo lead-in, subjects self-administered pramlintide (180 microg) or placebo by subcutaneous injection 15 min before meals for 6 wk without concomitant lifestyle modifications. Compared with placebo, pramlintide treatment elicited significant mean reductions from baseline in body weight on day 44 (-2.1 +/- 0.3 vs. +0.1 +/- 0.4%, P < 0.001), 24-h caloric intake (-990 +/- 94 vs. -243 +/- 126 kcal on day 3, P < 0.0001; -680 +/- 86 vs. -191 +/- 161 kcal on day 43, P < 0.01), portion sizes, and caloric intake at a 'fast food challenge' (-385 +/- 61 vs. -109 +/- 88 kcal on day 44, P < 0.05). Pramlintide treatment also improved perceived control of eating, as demonstrated by a 45% placebo-corrected reduction in binge eating scores (P < 0.01). The results of this translational research study confirm in humans various preclinical effects of amylin agonism, demonstrating that pramlintide-mediated weight loss in obese subjects is accompanied by sustained reductions in 24-h food intake, portion sizes, fast food intake, and binge eating tendencies.","Pramlintide treatment reduces 24-h caloric intake and meal sizes and improves control of eating in obese subjects: a 6-wk translational research study.","American journal of physiology.

Impulsivity is a contributory feature of some eating disorders. OBJECTIVE: Experiments investigated the effect of lorcaserin and the highly selective 5-HT2C agonist CP-809101 on measures of impulsivity and on reinstatement of food-seeking behaviour, a model of dietary relapse. The effect of both drugs on 22-h deprivation-induced feeding was also examined, as was the effect of prefeeding in each impulsivity test. RESULTS: Lorcaserin (0.3-0.6 mg/kg SC) and CP-809101 (0.6-1 mg/kg SC) reduced premature responding in rats trained on the 5-CSRTT and improved accuracy in a Go-NoGo task by reducing false alarms. At equivalent doses, both drugs also reduced reinstatement for food-seeking behaviour. Neither drug altered impulsive choice measured in a delay-discounting task. Lorcaserin (1-3 mg/kg SC) and CP-809101 (3-6 mg/kg SC) reduced deprivation-induced feeding but only at higher doses. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that in addition to previously reported effects on satiety and reward, altered impulse control may represent a contributory factor to the anti-obesity property of 5-HT2C receptor agonists. Lorcaserin may promote weight loss by improving adherence to dietary regimens in individuals otherwise prone to relapse and may be beneficial in cases where obesity is associated with eating disorders tied to impulsive traits, such as binge eating disorder.","Lorcaserin and CP-809101 reduce motor impulsivity and reinstatement of food seeking behavior in male rats: Implications for understanding the anti-obesity property of 5-HT2C receptor agonists.","Psychopharmacology","Higgins GA and Silenieks LB and Altherr EB and MacMillan C and Fletcher PJ and Pratt WE","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 14:05:55,-1,2021-03-08 19:26:56,,,,,,,,

Even though BE is a common symptom in bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED), and some cases of other specified feeding or eating disorders, little is known about its pathophysiology. We aimed to identify brain regions and neuron subtypes implicated in the development of binge-like eating in a female rat model. We separated rats into binge eating prone (BEP) and binge eating resistant (BER) phenotypes based on the amount of sucrose they consumed following foot-shock stress. We quantified deltaFosB (DeltaFosB) expression, a stably expressed Fos family member, in different brain regions involved in reward, taste, or stress processing, to assess their involvement in the development of the phenotype. The number of DeltaFosB-expressing neurons was: (1) higher in BEP than BER rats in reward processing areas [medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), nucleus accumbens (Acb), and ventral tegmental area (VTA)]; (2) similar in taste processing areas [insular cortex, IC and parabrachial nucleus (PBN)]; and (3) higher in the paraventricular nucleus of BEP than BER rats, but not different in the locus coeruleus (LC), which are stress processing structures. To study subtypes of DeltaFosB-expressing neurons in the reward system, we performed in situ hybridization for glutamate decarboxylase 65 and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA after DeltaFosB immunohistochemistry. In the mPFC and Acb, the proportions of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) and non-GABAergic DeltaFosB-expressing neurons were similar in BER and BEP rats. In the VTA, while the proportion of dopaminergic DeltaFosB-expressing neurons was similar in both phenotypes, the proportion of GABAergic DeltaFosB-expressing neurons was higher in BER than BEP rats.

In the restricted feeding groups, almost all animals moved around furiously (food-seeking activity) when they came to consume all the food provided at 2-3 wk of the treatment in LD and after several weeks in SD with the initiation of photorefractoriness, and ended up with death. In the restricted feeding groups, body weight increase was not observed. The furious food-seeking activity in the restricted groups and the increase of body weight specific food intake (food intake/body weight) in the ad-lib feeding groups might reflect the increased requirement for food.

Three types of natural reward were used, food reward (2.5, 4, 15, 30, 40, and 60% sucrose solutions), social reward (male rat) and sexual reward (estrous female rat). For each type of natural stimulus, consummatory behavior and motivational behaviors under varied testing conditions were investigated. The results showed that the morphine-treated rats significantly reduced their consumption of 2.5% sucrose solution during the 1-h consumption testing and their operant responding for 15, 30, and 40% sucrose solutions under a fixed ratio 1 (FR1) schedule. However, performance under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule increased in morphine-treated rats reinforced with 60% sucrose solution, but not in those reinforced with sucrose concentrations lower than 60%. Pretreatment with morphine significantly decreased the male rats' ejaculation frequency (EF) during the 1-h copulation testing, and impaired the maintenance of appetitive motivations to sexual and social stimuli under a free-approach condition. Moreover, the morphine-treated rats demonstrated a diminished motivation to approach social stimulus in the effort-based appetitive behavior test but showed a remarkable increase in motivation to approach sexual stimulus in the risky appetitive behavior test. These results demonstrated some complex motivated behaviors following about 1 week of morphine withdrawal: (1) The anhedonia-like behavior was consistently found in animals withdrawn from morphine. However, for a given reward, there was often a dissociation of the consummatory behaviors from the motivational behaviors, and whether the consummatory or the motivational anhedonia-like behaviors could be discovered heavily depended on the type and magnitude of the reward and the type of testing task; (2) These anhedonia-like behaviors coexisted with a craving for the high-incentive reward which was evidenced by the increased PR performance for the 60% sucrose solution and the heightened risky appetitive behavior for the sexual stimulus. The craving for the high-incentive reward alongside with the impaired inhibitory control in drug-withdrawn subjects might form one of psychological mechanisms underlying drug relapse after withdrawal.","Complex motivated behaviors for natural rewards following a binge-like regimen of morphine administration: mixed phenotypes of anhedonia and craving after short-term withdrawal.","Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience","Bai Y and Li Y and Lv Y and Liu Z and Zheng X","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,drug, optogenetic or comoribities at the time of intermittent protocol,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-16 17:50:44,-1,2021-02-17 00:31:50,,,,,,,,

At dark onset, rats displayed a preference for carbohydrate, with the first meal of the night consisting of approximately 60% of this nutrient. This carbohydrate intake was soon followed by a shift toward protein-predominant meals. Superimposed on this pattern of meal-to-meal shifts in nutrient selection appears to be an additional rhythm in which carbohydrate ingestion was favored at dark onset and protein and fat ingestion were favored during the late dark hours. Differential feeding patterns were also apparent following mild food deprivation. A 2-h period of deprivation at dark onset produced a strong compensatory feeding response, particularly of fat and carbohydrate. This pattern was not observed at the end of the dark, when little compensatory feeding was demonstrated.

In order for memory reconsolidation to occur, a memory first needs to be reactivated. It has been shown recently that memory retrieval during awake/sleep phases may affect susceptibility to memory reactivation. Given the importance of hippocampal gamma frequencies in memory processes, the purpose of the present research was to study changes in gamma bands power during retrieval of instrumental appetitive memories. Local field potentials were recorded in the CA1 area of dorsal hippocampus of Sprague Dawley rats during retrieval of instrumental appetitive memory performed either during light or dark phases of the circadian cycle. Appetitive memory retrieval was performed by using a protocol of sucrose self-administration in operant chambers equipped with levers (Piva et al., 2018): rats were first trained to self-administer sucrose pellets and, after a 14-days forced abstinence stage, memory retrieval stage consisted in training context exposure. At the retrival stage performed during the light phase, a decreased low-gamma power was observed in CA1 when rats were not lever pressing compared to when they were lever pressing (actual instrumental memory retrieval). Moreover, results showed an inverse correlation between gamma power and rate of responding when retrieval was performed in the dark phase. Our findings suggest that hippocampal gamma power is differently modulated when retrieval is performed during the light phase compared to the dark phase. Further investigations should explore the role of gamma oscillations as potential markers of instrumental appetitive memory reactivation in both light and dark conditions.","Hippocampal gamma oscillations by sucrose instrumental memory retrieval in rats across sleep/wake cycle.","Neuroscience letters","Padovani L and Tesoriero C and Vyssotski A and Bentivoglio M and Chiamulera C","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-18 19:18:45,-1,2021-02-19 01:58:19,,,,,,,,

During 12 days of exposure, the animals were tested on operant intraoral self-administration (IOSA) of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) on continuous (FR1) and progressive ratio (PR) schedules, on home cage drinking of HFCS, and on HFCS taste reactivity. Locomotion activity was also assessed. At the conclusion of the study, mRNA expression of genes involved in reward processing, appetite and mood were quantified. It was found that BN produced effects that could largely be ascribed to either BUP or NTX independently. More specifically, BN-induced reductions of HFCS IOSA on a FR1 schedule and home cage drinking, as well as alterations of MOR and POMC mRNA in the nucleus accumbens core and hypothalamus respectively, were attributable to NTX; while alterations of hippocampal BDNF mRNA was attributable to BUP. But, there was also some evidence of drug synergy: only BN caused persistent reductions of HFCS IOSA and drinking; BN produced the least gain of body weight; and only BN-treated rats displayed altered D2R mRNA in the caudate-putamen.

METHODS: We investigated orexin's contribution to food-reinforced instrumental responding using an orexin 1 receptor (Ox1r) antagonist, orexin -/- (OKO) and littermate wildtype (WT) mice, and RNAi-mediated knockdown of orexin. C57BL/6J (n = 76) and OKO (n = 39) mice were trained to nose poke for food under a variable ratio schedule of reinforcement. After responding stabilized, a progressive ratio schedule was initiated to evaluate motivation to obtain food reinforcement. RESULTS: Blockade of Ox1r in C57BL/6J mice impaired performance under both the variable ratio and progressive ratio schedules of reinforcement, indicating impaired motivational processes. In contrast, OKO mice initially demonstrated a delay in acquisition but eventually achieved levels of responding similar to those observed in WT animals. Moreover, OKO mice did not differ from WT mice under a progressive ratio schedule, indicating delayed learning processes but no motivational impairments. Considering the differences between pharmacologic blockade of Ox1r and the OKO mice, animals with RNAi mediated knockdown of orexin were then generated and analyzed to eliminate possible developmental effects of missing orexin. Orexin gene knockdown in the lateral hypothalamus in C57BL/6J mice resulted in blunted performance under both the variable ratio and progressive ratio schedules, resembling data obtained following Ox1r antagonism. CONCLUSIONS: The behavior seen in OKO mice likely reflects developmental compensation often seen in mutant animals. These data suggest that activation of the Ox1r is a necessary component of food-reinforced responding, motivation, or both in normal mice.","Orexin signaling via the orexin 1 receptor mediates operant responding for food reinforcement.","Biological psychiatry","Sharf R and Sarhan M and Brayton CE and Guarnieri DJ and Taylor JR and DiLeone RJ","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 23:06:16,-1,2021-03-09 22:13:22,,,,,,,,

Dietary manipulations result in changes in endocrine the and/or neuropeptide signals, such as the hormones leptin and ghrelin, which are dynamically linked to energy balance and the regulation of feeding behavior. We have recently demonstrated that food deprivation-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking can be blocked with leptin, and others have suggested a role for ghrelin in drug-related behaviors. The feeding-relevant effects of leptin and ghrelin involve the inhibition or activation, respectively, of neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (NPY/AGRP) neurons in the hypothalamus. However, the effects of NPY, a highly potent orexigenic peptide, on drug-related behaviors have not been thoroughly studied. Here we examined the effect of acute NPY administration on the rate of heroin self-administration and the reinstatement of extinguished heroin-seeking behavior. Heroin intake (0.05mg/kg/infusion) was tested using a self-administration procedure (FR-1), 10-min post-NPY injections (0.0, 4.0, and 10microg/rat, ICV). In a different group of rats, NPY-induced reinstatement (0.0, 4.0, and 10microg/rat, ICV) of extinguished heroin seeking was assessed. NPY injections increased on-going heroin self-administration, and induced a reinstatement of extinguished heroin-seeking behavior.

In the present study, we assessed the expression of anhedonia in our chronic stress mouse model using a subset of read-out parameters. In line with this, we investigated in how far chronic stress would affect the facilitating effect of post-training self-administration of sugar, as we previously observed in naive mice. Male C57BL/6J mice were repeatedly and at unpredictable times exposed to rats (no physical contact) over the course of two weeks. Following novelty exploration, (non-) spatial learning and memory processes with and without post-training sugar acting as reinforcer, emotionality, reward sensitivity and corticosterone levels were determined. We found that (1) the effects of chronic stress persisted beyond the period of the actual rat exposure. (2) Post-training self-administration of sugar as reinforcer improved spatial performance in naive mice, whereas (3) in stressed mice sugar partially 'normalized' the impaired performance to the level of controls without sugar. Chronic stress (4) increased behavioral inhibition in response to novelty; (5) induced dynamic changes in the pattern of circadian corticosterone secretion during the first week after rat stress and (6) increased the intake of sucrose and water. (7) Chronic stress and sugar consumed during spatial training facilitated the memory for the location of the sucrose bottle weeks later. Concluding, our chronic stress paradigm induces the expression of anhedonia in mice, at different levels of behavior. The behavioral inhibition appears to be long lasting in stressed mice. Interestingly, sugar consumed in close context with spatial learning partially rescued the stress-induced emotional and cognitive impairments.

However, whether consumption of appetitive macronutrients themselves causes deficits in impulse control and striatal signalling, thereby contributing to cognitive changes permissive of overeating behaviour, has yet to be considered. We examined the effects of chronic maintenance on restricted equicaloric, but high-fat or high-sugar, diets (48 kcal/day; 60 kcal% fat or sucrose) on rats' performance in the five-choice serial reaction time task, indexing impulsivity and attention. Markers of dopamine signalling in the dorsal and ventral striatum, and plasma insulin and leptin levels, were also assessed. Rats maintained on the high-fat diet (HFD) were more impulsive, whereas the high-sugar diet (HSD) did not alter task performance. Importantly, body weight and hormone levels were similar between groups when behavioural changes were observed. Maintenance on HFD, but not on HSD, reduced the levels of dopamine D2 receptor (D2 R), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and phosphophorylated CREB (Ser133) proteins in the ventral, but not dorsal, striatum. D2 R expression in the ventral striatum also negatively correlated with impulsive responding, independently of diet.

Male Wistar rats were trained under an exponential progressive ratio schedule of sucrose reinforcement; thereafter, the limited access model was used to induce BLE. Finally, subjects were tested for increments in break points (BPs) in the progressive ratio schedule. We were unable to observe an increase in BPs after BLE. No increments in BPs were observed when a distinctive flavor (vanilla-flavored sucrose) was correlated with BLE induction and reinforcement, or when different types of ratio progression in the operant schedules were employed. However, rats adjusted their BPs according to reinforcer concentration after BLE induction, demonstrating that valuation (cost/benefit decision) of reinforcers was intact.

Curcumin, a natural polyphenolic compound of curcuma loga, has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of depressive-like disorders. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the antidepressant-like effects of curcumin in a rat model of chronic, unpredictable, mild, stress (CUMS) -induced depression. The results showed that CUMS produced depressive-like behaviours in rats, which were associated with ultra-structural changes in neurons within the lateral amygdala (LA). In addition, the expression of synapse-associated proteins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), PSD-95 and synaptophysin were significantly decreased in the LA of CUMS-treated rats. Chronic administration of curcumin (40 mg/kg, i.p. 6 wk) before stress exposure significantly prevented these neuronal and biochemical alterations induced by CUMS, and suppressed depressive-like behaviours, suggesting that this neuronal dysregulation may be related to the depressive-like behaviours caused by CUMS. Together with our previous results, the current findings demonstrate that curcumin exhibits neuroprotection and antidepressant-like effects in the CUMS-induced depression model.

Different studies have demonstrated the role of endogenous cannabinoids in the mesocorticolimbic system in controlling food hedonic value and consumption. We hypothesize that the endogenous cannabinoid system could also be involved in the development of food-induced behavioral alterations, such as food-seeking and binge-eating, by a mechanism that requires neuroplastic changes in the brain reward pathway. For this purpose, we evaluated the role of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1-R) in the behavioral and neuroplastic changes induced by operant training for standard, highly caloric or highly palatable isocaloric food using different genetics, viral and pharmacological approaches. Neuroplasticity was evaluated by measuring changes in dendritic spine density in neurons previously labeled with the dye DiI. Only operant training to obtain highly palatable isocaloric food induced neuroplastic changes in neurons of the nucleus accumbens shell and prefrontal cortex that were associated to changes in food-seeking behavior. These behavioral and neuroplastic modifications induced by highly palatable isocaloric food were dependent on the activity of the CB1-R. Neuroplastic changes induced by highly palatable isocaloric food are similar to those produced by some drugs of abuse and may be crucial in the alteration of food-seeking behavior leading to overweight and obesity.","Operant behavior to obtain palatable food modifies neuronal plasticity in the brain reward circuit.","European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Guegan T and Cutando L and Ayuso E and Santini E and Fisone G and Bosch F and Martinez A and Valjent E and Maldonado R and Martin M","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 23:14:44,-1,2021-03-09 22:17:37,,,,,,,,

Rats were randomly assigned to a control group without chocolate access, to ad libitum access to chocolate, to fixed intermittent access (CH-F), or to random unpredictable access (CH-R) to chocolate. Only the CH-F group developed behavioral and core temperature anticipation to PF access. Both groups exposed to intermittent access to PF showed binge eating, increased effort behaviors to obtain chocolate, as well as high FosB/DeltaFosB in corticolimbic areas. Moreover, FosB/DeltaFosB in all areas correlated with the intensity of binge eating and effort behaviors.

Measurements of entry into S-phase were made in vivo of six different cell types in five different organs using 2-week exposures to BrdU. The labeling index (L.I.) in all organs studied was lower in young CR mice than in young AL fed mice. In most cases, the L.I. in AL mice fell to the levels of that in the CR mice by 13 months of age, and the two groups then remained so through old age. However, when the L.I. was measured in old CR mice which had been placed on the AL diet for a period of 4 weeks (this was termed refeeding (RF), it was found to be above that of similar age AL or CR mice and almost at the level of young AL mice. This was still true, but to a lesser degree, in a repeat study using an 8-week period of RF. In a separate but parallel in vitro study (companion paper, this volume), the superiority of CR over AL for retention of cellular replication capacity was confirmed by clone size distribution measurements made in several cell types in mice of several age groups. These results indicate that: (1) the rate of cell replication in AL diet mice diminishes greatly by early middle age in all organ sites studied and then plateaus or declines much more slowly; (2) CR broadly preserves in vivo cellular replicative capacity but often requires the energy levels provided by a switch to AL feeding to demonstrate this late in life; (3) accordingly, the replicative deficit in AL fed mice appears to be cumulative and is significant only in old age.

Such feedings may have been essential for producing the previous observation (Graf, Balsam, & Silver, 1985) that pecking develops normally if squab which have been separated from their parents are given a daily 20-min interaction with seed followed by an immediate return to their parents. Experiment 2 showed that exposure to seed followed by experimenter-provided feedings were sufficient for inducing adult pecking levels. Experiment 3 showed that general experience with conspecifics was not necessary for the development of pecking and that maturation alone could not account for the pecking observed in previous experiments. Experiment 4 showed that Pavlovian contingencies consisting of visual exposure to seed followed by feeding was sufficient to induce high levels of pecking. There did not appear to be an additional contribution of an operant contingency present when squab were allowed to both see and peck at seed prior to feedings in Experiment 5. However, squab must actually be given experience in handling and ingesting seeds before adult levels of pecking can be obtained.

New cancer targeted therapies have become widely used, and their impact on brain functions and quality of life needs to be explored. We evaluated the impact of everolimus, an anticancer agent targeting the mTOR pathway, on cognitive functions, cerebral metabolism, and hippocampal cell proliferation/vascular density in mice. Adult mice received everolimus daily for 2 weeks, and behavioral tests were performed from 1 week after the last treatment. Everolimus-treated mice displayed a marked reduction in weight gain from the last day of the treatment period. Ex vivo analysis showed altered cytochrome oxidase activity in selective cerebral regions involved in energy balance, food intake, reward, learning and memory modulation, sleep/wake cycle regulation, and arousal. Like chemotherapy, everolimus did not alter emotional reactivity, learning and memory performances, but in contrast to chemotherapy, did not affect behavioral flexibility or reactivity to novelty. In vivo hippocampal neural cell proliferation and vascular density were also unchanged after everolimus treatments. In conclusion, two weeks daily everolimus treatment at the clinical dose did not evoke alteration of cognitive performances evaluated in hippocampal- and prefrontal cortex-dependent tasks that would persist at one to four weeks after the end of the treatment completion. However, acute everolimus treatment caused selective CO modifications without altering the mTOR effector P70S6 kinase in cerebral regions involved in feeding behavior and/or the sleep/wake cycle, at least in part under control of the solitary nucleus and the parasubthalamic region of the hypothalamus.

Goal-directed control was then assessed using specific satiety-induced outcome devaluation. Rats were given 1 h access to one of theoutcomes and were then immediately given a choice between the two actions. Rats maintained on restriction responded more for the valued than the devalued reward but rats with a history of restriction and refeeding failed to show this effect. Importantly, all rats showed sensory-specific satiety when offered a choice between the two foods, indicating that pre-feeding selectively reduced the value of the pre-fed food. By contrast, sensory-specific satiety was not observed in rats with a history of intermittent feeding when the foods were offered sequentially.

Intact females self-administered larger amounts of CFB, when expressed per body weight, than males and ovariectomized females, in spite of similar values of lever-responding, latency to the first lever-response and consumption efficiency (a measure of rat's licking effectiveness) in males, ovariectomized and intact females and no difference in breakpoint value and number of lever-responses emerged when males, ovariectomized and intact females were exposed to a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. Intracerebral microdialysis revealed a slight but significant increase in dopamine activity in the shell of the nucleus accumbens of male rats when compared to intact female rats during CFB self-administration. The above differences may be caused by the hormonal (mainly estradiol) fluctuations that occur during the estrus cycle in intact females. Accordingly, in intact females CFB self-administration and dopamine activity were found to fluctuate across the estrus cycle, with lower parameters of CFB self-administration and lower dopamine activity in the Proestrus and Estrus phases vs. the Metestrus and Diestrus phases of the cycle.","Comparison between male and female rats in a model of self-administration of a chocolate-flavored beverage: Behavioral and neurochemical studies.","Behavioural brain research","Contini A and Sanna F and Maccioni P and Colombo G and Argiolas A","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 20:39:23,-1,2021-03-09 22:22:00,,,,,,,,

Energy is rapidly stored as fat while feeding, and then rapidly utilized during the non-feeding period. Almost one-third of the extractable whole body fat is lost during a 14 hour non-feeding period. Less fat is stored while feeding at 11 degrees C. Thus missing a single feeding period at this cooler temperature results in a total depletion of fat stores.

Little, however, is known concerning obesity's impact on sensory systems. Because olfaction is linked with ingestive behavior to guide food choice, its potential dysfunction during obesity could evoke a positive feedback loop to perpetuate poor ingestive behaviors. To determine the effect of chronic energy imbalance and reveal any structural or functional changes associated with obesity, we induced long-term, diet-induced obesity by challenging mice to high-fat diets: (1) in an obesity-prone (C57BL/6J) and obesity-resistant (Kv1.3(-/-)) line of mice, and compared this with (2) late-onset, genetic-induced obesity in MC4R(-/-) mice in which diabetes secondarily precipitates after disruption of the hypothalamic axis. We report marked loss of olfactory sensory neurons and their axonal projections after exposure to a fatty diet, with a concomitant reduction in electro-olfactogram amplitude. Loss of olfactory neurons and associated circuitry is linked to changes in neuronal proliferation and normal apoptotic cycles. Using a computer-controlled, liquid-based olfactometer, mice maintained on fatty diets learn reward-reinforced behaviors more slowly, have deficits in reversal learning demonstrating behavioral inflexibility, and exhibit reduced olfactory discrimination. When obese mice are removed from their high-fat diet to regain normal body weight and fasting glucose, olfactory dysfunctions are retained. We conclude that chronic energy imbalance therefore presents long-lasting structural and functional changes in the operation of the sensory system designed to encode external and internal chemical information and leads to altered olfactory- and reward-driven behaviors.","Hyperlipidemic diet causes loss of olfactory sensory neurons, reduces olfactory discrimination, and disrupts odor-reversal learning.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Thiebaud N and Johnson MC and Butler JL and Bell GA and Ferguson KL and Fadool AR and Fadool JC and Gale AM and Gale DS and Fadool DA","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-22 23:17:38,-1,2021-03-09 22:23:35,,,,,,,,

Rats given glucose in the intermittent access model (IAM) display signatures of hedonic feeding including bingeing and altered DA receptor (R) numbers within the NAc. Here we examined whether substituting fructose for glucose in this IAM produces bingeing behavior, alters DA Rs and activates hedonic and homeostatic feeding centers. Following long-term (21-day) exposure to the IAM, rats given 8-12% fructose solutions displayed fructose bingeing but unaltered DA D1R or D2R number. Fructose bingeing rats, as compared to chow bingeing controls, exhibited reduced NAc shell neuron activation, as determined by c-Fos-immunoreactivity (Fos-IR). This activation was negatively correlated with orexin (Orx) neuron activation in the lateral hypothalamus/perifornical area (LH/PeF), a brain region linking homeostatic to hedonic feeding centers. Following short-term (2-day) access to the IAM, rats exhibited bingeing but unchanged Fos-IR, suggesting only long-term fructose bingeing increases Orx release. In long-term fructose bingeing rats, pretreatment with the Ox1R antagonist SB-334867 (30 mg/kg; i.p.) equally reduced fructose bingeing and chow intake, resulting in a 50% reduction in calories. Similarly, in control rats, SB-334867 reduced chow/caloric intake by 60%. Thus, in the IAM, Ox1Rs appear to regulate feeding based on caloric content rather than palatability. Overall, our results, in combination with the literature, suggest individual monosaccharides activate distinct neuronal circuits to promote feeding behavior. Specifically, long-term fructose bingeing activates a hyperphagic circuit composed in part of NAc shell and LH/PeF Orx neurons.","A relationship between reduced nucleus accumbens shell and enhanced lateral hypothalamic orexin neuronal activation in long-term fructose bingeing behavior.","PloS one","Rorabaugh JM and Stratford JM and Zahniser NR","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc),no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-23 14:39:51,-1,2021-03-09 22:24:36,,,,,,,,

Daily rhythms of clock gene expression throughout the brain and body are normally coordinated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), but they are also strongly influenced by daily temporal restrictions of food availability. Here, we studied the effects of a daily restricted presentation of highly palatable complete meal replacement, chocolate Ensure Plus (Ensure) in food-deprived (restricted feeding, RF) and free-fed (restricted treat, RT) rats, on the expression of the clock protein, Period2 (PER2) in regions of the brain involved in motivational and emotional regulation; these include the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTov), the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA), the basolateral amygdala (BLA), the dentate gyrus (DG) and the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH). RF and RT rats consumed similar amounts of Ensure, but changes in the pattern of PER2 expression were seen only in the RF condition, suggesting that changes in PER2 expression in these regions are triggered by the daily alleviation of a negative metabolic state associated with RF and are independent of the positive incentive properties of the consumed substance, per se. In contrast, the expression of the immediate early gene, Fos, was increased in these regions by both RF and RT schedules, showing that signals concerning the incentive value of the consumed food reach these regions. No changes in either PER2 or Fos expression were observed in the SCN of RF or RT rats. These findings demonstrate that mechanisms leading to changes in the expression of PER2 and those affecting the induction of Fos under RF and RT are, at least in part, dissociable.","Differential regulation of the expression of Period2 protein in the limbic forebrain and dorsomedial hypothalamus by daily limited access to highly palatable food in food-deprived and free-fed rats.","Neuroscience","Verwey M and Khoja Z and Stewart J and Amir S","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc),no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-02-16 18:02:19,-1,2021-02-17 00:49:14,,,,,,,,

The cell types that mediate these behavioral functions, however, are not well described. We report here that optogenetic activation of vasoactive peptide expressing (VIP) interneurons in both the infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PL) divisions of the medial prefrontal cortex in mice is sufficient to reduce acute, binge-like intake of high calorie palatable food in the absence of any effect on low calorie rodent chow intake in the sated animal. In addition, we discovered that the behavioral mechanisms associated with these changes in feeding differed between animals that underwent either IL or PL VIPergic stimulation. While IL VIP neurons showed the ability to reduce palatable food intake, this effect was dependent upon the novelty and relative value of the food source. In addition, IL VIP neuron activation significantly reduced novel object- and novel social investigative behavior. Activation of PL VIP neurons, however, produced a reduction in high calorie palatable food intake that was independent of food novelty. Neither IL nor PL VIP excitation changed motivation to obtain food reward.

However, the etiology of this behavior is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between medical therapy for PD and pathological gambling. METHODS: In our routine movement disorders practice (2002-2004), we encountered 11 patients with idiopathic PD who had recently developed pathological gambling. We assessed the relationship to their medical therapy and compared them with cases identified by systematic review of the existing literature on pathological gambling and PD. RESULTS: All 11 patients with PD and pathological gambling were taking therapeutic doses of a dopamine agonist; 3 of these patients were not treated with levodopa. In 7 patients, pathological gambling developed within 3 months of starting to take or escalating the dose of the agonist; in the other 4 with a longer latency, gambling resolved after the agonist use was discontinued. Pramipexole dihydrochloride was the agonist in 9 of 11 cases in our series and 10 of 17 in the literature (68% in total). CONCLUSIONS: Dopamine agonist therapy was associated with potentially reversible pathological gambling, and pramipexole was the medication predominantly implicated. This may relate to disproportionate stimulation of dopamine D(3) receptors, which are primarily localized to the limbic system.","Pathological gambling caused by drugs used to treat Parkinson disease.","Archives of neurology","Dodd ML and Klos KJ and Bower JH and Geda YE and Josephs KA and Ahlskog JE","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:09:57,-1,2021-04-07 19:27:15,,,,,,,,

Here we asked whether this variation is influenced by properties of the CS itself. In rats, we assessed both the attractiveness and conditioned reinforcing properties of two CSs: a manipulable lever CS versus an auditory (tone) CS. There was considerable individual variation in the extent to which a lever CS acquired incentive motivational properties, as indicated by whether it became attractive (evoked a sign-tracking or goal-tracking conditioned response) or acted as a conditioned reinforcer. However, with a tone CS all rats learned a goal-tracking response, and the tone CS was an equally effective conditioned reinforcer in sign-trackers and goal-trackers. Even when presented in compound (a lever-tone CS), the two elements of the compound differentially acquired motivational properties. In contrast, amphetamine and stress potentiated the conditioned reinforcing properties of both visual and auditory CSs similarly in rats that primarily sign-tracked or goal-tracked.

Previous rat studies showed that enduring alcohol self-administration despite pairing alcohol with normally aversive stimuli was only observed after very long-term intake (>8 months). Aversion-resistant alcohol intake has been previously interpreted to indicate pathological or compulsive motivation to consume alcohol. However, given the time required to model compulsive alcohol seeking in previous studies, there is considerable interest in developing more efficient and quantitative rodent models of aversion-resistant alcohol self-administration. METHODS: Outbred Wistar rats underwent 3 to 4 months or approximately 1.5 months of intermittent, home-cage, two-bottle access (IAA) to 20% alcohol (v/v) or water. Then, after brief operant training, the effect of the bitter-tasting quinine (0.1 g/l) on the motivation to seek alcohol was quantified via progressive ratio (PR). Motivation for quinine-adulterated 2% sucrose under PR was assayed in a separate cohort of 3 to 4 months IAA rats. The effects of quinine on home-cage alcohol consumption in IAA rats and rats with continuous access to alcohol were also examined. Finally, a dose-response for quinine taste preference in IAA and continuous-access animals was determined. RESULTS: Motivation for alcohol after 3 to 4 months IAA, measured using an operant PR procedure, was not altered by adulteration of alcohol with 0.1 g/l quinine. In contrast, after 3 to 4 months of IAA, motivation for sucrose under PR was significantly reduced by adulteration of sucrose with 0.1 g/l quinine. In addition, motivation for alcohol after only approximately 1.5 months IAA was significantly reduced by adulteration of alcohol with 0.1 g/l quinine. Furthermore, home-cage alcohol intake by IAA rats was insensitive to quinine at concentrations (0.01, 0.03 g/l) that significantly reduced alcohol drinking in animals with continuous access to alcohol. Finally, no changes in quinine taste preference after 3 to 4 months IAA or continuous access to alcohol were observed. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a novel and technically simple hybrid operant/IAA model in which quinine-resistant motivation for alcohol is evident after an experimentally tractable period of time (3 to 4 months vs. 8 months). Quinine dramatically reduced sucrose and water intake by IAA rats, indicating that continued responding for alcohol in IAA rats despite adulteration with the normally aversive quinine might reflect maladaptive or compulsive motivation for alcohol. This model could facilitate identification of novel therapeutic interventions for pathological alcohol seeking in humans.","Motivation for alcohol becomes resistant to quinine adulteration after 3 to 4 months of intermittent alcohol self-administration.","Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research","Hopf FW and Chang SJ and Sparta DR and Bowers MS and Bonci A","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 14:25:43,-1,2021-03-29 16:10:28,,,,,,,,

However, these hypotheses are derived from studies employing peripheral or, more rarely, intracerebroventricular administration of drugs. Opioid receptors have a wide distribution in the central nervous system and include a number of regions implicated in food intake such as the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and the central nucleus of the amygdala (ACe). It is not known whether local opioid receptor blockade in either of these regions will produce similar effects on food intake. To examine this issue, a chronic cannula was aimed at either the PVN or ACe of rats that were fed a choice of a high-fat and high-carbohydrate diet, which allows for the measurement of both preference and total energy consumption. Naltrexone influenced preferred and nonpreferred food consumption, depending on the site of administration. Consumption of both preferred and nonpreferred diets was suppressed after PVN naltrexone administration, whereas only preferred diet intake was reduced after ACe injection of naltrexone. The present evidence indicates that direct stimulation of different brain regions with naltrexone may be associated with diverse effects on diet selection, which may be accounted for by manipulation of specific functional neural circuitry.","Naltrexone administered to central nucleus of amygdala or PVN: neural dissociation of diet and energy.","American journal of physiology.

We hypothesized that repeated exposure to uncertainty during gambling induces behavioural and dopamine (DA) sensitization - similar to chronic exposure to drugs of abuse. Uncertainty exposure (UE) may also increase risky decision-making in an animal model of gambling disorder. METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats received 56 UE sessions, during which animals responded for saccharin according to an unpredictable, variable ratio schedule of reinforcement (VR group). Control animals responded on a predictable, fixed ratio schedule (FR group). Rats yoked to receive unpredictable reward were also included (Y group). Animals were then tested on the Rat Gambling Task (rGT), an analogue of the Iowa Gambling Task, to measure decision-making. RESULTS: Compared with the FR group, the VR and Y groups experienced a greater locomotor response following administration of amphetamine. On the rGT, the FR and Y groups preferred the advantageous options over the risky, disadvantageous options throughout testing (40 sessions). However, rats in the VR group did not have a significant preference for the advantageous options during sessions 20-40. Amphetamine had a small, but significant, effect on decision-making only in the VR group. After rGT testing, only the VR group showed greater hyperactivity following administration of amphetamine compared with the FR group. LIMITATIONS: Reward uncertainty was the only gambling feature modelled.

Computational models derived from single-unit recordings capture changes in dopaminergic neuron firing rate as a prediction error signal. These models employ the prediction error signal in two roles: learning to predict future rewarding events and biasing action choice. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition or lesion of dopaminergic neuron function diminishes the ability of an animal to motivate behaviors directed at acquiring rewards. These lesion experiments have raised the possibility that dopamine release encodes a measure of the incentive value of a contemplated behavioral act. The most complete psychological idea that captures this notion frames the dopamine signal as carrying 'incentive salience'. On the surface, these two competing accounts of dopamine function seem incommensurate.

Ignoring this challenge, experimentation in animal psychology has been dominated by the session paradigm in which animals work in brief sessions for a resource of which they have been deprived. In this open economy, no behavioral strategy of the animal can meet its demand, and the beginnings and ends of bouts are controlled by the experimenter; thus, Richter's problem cannot be addressed. In contrast, in a free-feeding, closed economy, the animal controls the initiation and termination of feeding and can regulate its intake, and bout patterns can be observed. If the paradigm is modified to simulate a habitat where resources are distributed discontinuously and the animal must work to discover and procure access to a commodity before it can be used, behavioral strategies allowing the animal to regulate its intake while tending to maximize the ratio of benefits to costs are revealed. We offer an answer to Richter's question based on a cost/benefit analysis of feeding behavior in this foraging paradigm. We show that the time and energy costs of resource acquisition and resource consumption are powerful determinants of the pattern of resource use, and that they have different and independent effects. The former costs are reduced by reducing the frequency of initiating bouts, and the latter costs, by altering the rate and amount of consumption. Further, the time window of these relations is much longer than expected from analyses in the session paradigm. We conclude that the recurrent nature of behavior is due to the discontinuous distribution of resources rather than to cycles of physiological depletion and repletion, and that the determinants of bout initiation and termination lie in the economics of the allocation of time and effort to different resources and activities.","Who is in charge?

A genetic mutant approach was taken to examine the consequences of elevated synaptic dopamine on (1) spontaneous food and water intake, (2) incentive motivation and learning to obtain a palatable sweet reward in a runway task, and (3) affective 'liking' reactions elicited by the taste of sucrose. A dopamine transporter (DAT) knockdown mutation that preserves only 10% of normal DAT, and therefore causes mutant mice to have 70% elevated levels of synaptic dopamine, was used to identify dopamine effects on food intake and reward. We found that hyperdopaminergic DAT knockdown mutant mice have higher food and water intake. In a runway task, they demonstrated enhanced acquisition and greater incentive performance for a sweet reward. Hyperdopaminergic mutant mice leave the start box more quickly than wild-type mice, require fewer trials to learn, pause less often in the runway, resist distractions better, and proceed more directly to the goal. Those observations suggest that hyperdopaminergic mutant mice attribute greater incentive salience ('wanting') to a sweet reward in the runway test. But sucrose taste fails to elicit higher orofacial 'liking' reactions from mutant mice in an affective taste reactivity test. These results indicate that chronically elevated extracellular dopamine facilitates 'wanting' and learning of an incentive motivation task for a sweet reward, but elevated dopamine does not increase 'liking' reactions to the hedonic impact of sweet tastes.","Hyperdopaminergic mutant mice have higher 'wanting' but not 'liking' for sweet rewards.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Pecina S and Cagniard B and Berridge KC and Aldridge JW and Zhuang X","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:45:43,-1,2021-04-11 19:05:25,,,,,,,,

This suggests that Fischer and Lewis rats may differ in the initial, reinforcing effects of psychoactive drugs, but not in responses seen after the exposure that occurs with maintenance of drug-reinforced behavior. Thus, the present study tested whether these strains differ in acquisition or maintenance of intravenous cocaine self-administration. Acquisition of cocaine self-administration was examined in separate groups that were allowed 15 days to acquire the operant at one of three cocaine doses (0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg/infusion). Compared to Fischer rats, Lewis rats acquired cocaine self-administration after fewer training trials and at lower doses. After maintenance, both strains showed characteristic extinction responding with saline substitution and dose-related responding to cocaine, although Fischer rats tended to show higher response rates. Finally, cocaine plasma levels, obtained after an intravenous cocaine infusion (1.0 mg/kg), showed no strain differences suggesting that the strain difference in acquisition was not due to cocaine pharmacokinetics. These strain differences in acquisition of cocaine self-administration may be related to reported strain differences in the mesolimbic dopamine system. Further, because acquisition of drug self-administration is an animal model of vulnerability to drug addiction, these inbred strains may be useful to study factors underlying such vulnerability.","Acquisition and maintenance of intravenous cocaine self-administration in Lewis and Fischer inbred rat strains.","Brain research","Kosten TA and Miserendino MJ and Haile CN and DeCaprio JL and Jatlow PI and Nestler EJ","Drug-related intermittent or continuous access",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 14:00:19,-1,2021-04-11 19:23:45,,,,,,,,

Here we characterized changes in AMPA receptor distribution and phosphorylation state in the rat nucleus accumbens (NAcc) weeks after amphetamine exposure to assess their potential contribution to sensitization by this drug. Using protein cross-linking, biochemical, subcellular fractionation, and slice electrophysiological approaches in the NAcc, we found that, unlike cocaine, previous exposure to amphetamine did not increase cell surface levels of either GluA1 or GluA2 AMPA receptor subunits, redistribution of these subunits to the synaptic or perisynaptic cellular membrane domains, protein-protein associations required to support the accumulation and retention of AMPA receptors in the PSD, or the peak amplitude of AMPA receptor mediated mEPSCs recorded in NAcc slices. On the other hand, exposure to amphetamine significantly slowed mEPSC decay times and increased levels in the PSD of PKA and CaMKII as well as phosphorylation by these kinases of the GluA1 S845 and S831 residues selectively in this cellular compartment. As the latter effects are known to respectively regulate channel open probability and duration as well as conductance, they provide a novel mechanism that could contribute to the long-lasting AMPA receptor dependent expression of sensitization by amphetamine. Rather than increase the number of surface and synaptic AMPA receptors as with cocaine, this mechanism could increase NAcc medium spiny neuron reactivity to glutamate afferents by increasing the phosphorylation state of critical regulatory sites in the AMPA receptor GluA1 subunit in the PSD.","Sensitizing exposure to amphetamine increases AMPA receptor phosphorylation without increasing cell surface expression in the rat nucleus accumbens.","Neuropharmacology","Wang Q and Li D and Bubula N and Campioni MR and McGehee DS and Vezina P","Drug-related intermittent or continuous access",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 15:09:30,-1,2021-04-11 19:27:48,,,,,,,,

Functional activity, measured with metabolic mapping methods, and markers of the dopamine system, assessed autoradiographically, were evaluated over the course of chronic cocaine self-administration (5 days, 3.3 months, and 15-22 months). Within the striatum the topography of these responses shifts dramatically over time. Changes in functional activity and alterations in the dopamine system occupy larger and larger portions of dorsal and ventral striatum with increasing durations of cocaine exposure. The growing impact of cocaine suggests that the elements of the behavioral repertoire outside of the influence of cocaine become smaller and smaller with increasing durations of exposure to drug use resulting in cocaine's dominance over all aspects of the addict's life.","The expanding effects of cocaine: studies in a nonhuman primate model of cocaine self-administration.","Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews","Porrino LJ and Daunais JB and Smith HR and Nader MA","Drug-related intermittent or continuous access",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:25:37,-1,2021-04-09 15:51:42,,,,,,,,

Starting 10 days later, they were trained to self-administer cocaine (0.3 mg/kg/infusion, i.v.) and subsequently tested under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule for 4 consecutive days. As expected, rats exposed to AMPH worked more and obtained more cocaine infusions than saline exposed controls on the PR test sessions. Following daily extinction sessions during which saline was substituted for cocaine, the effect of priming infusions of AMPA (0.0, 0.08, or 0.8 nmol/0.5 microl/side) into the NAcc was then examined on two tests: one conducted 4 days after the last cocaine PR test session (2-3 weeks after the last AMPH exposure injection) and the next 4 weeks later. Consistent with previous reports, NAcc AMPA dose-dependently reinstated cocaine seeking on both tests regardless of exposure condition. Importantly, this priming effect of NAcc AMPA was significantly enhanced in AMPH compared to saline exposed rats on the first test conducted 2-3 weeks after AMPH. On the second test, conducted 4 weeks after cocaine, reinstatement was similarly enhanced in both groups to levels observed on the first test in AMPH exposed rats. These results indicate that both noncontingent (AMPH) and contingent (cocaine) exposure to psychostimulants enhances the reinstatement of cocaine seeking by NAcc AMPA and appears to do so in a time-dependent manner.","Previous exposure to psychostimulants enhances the reinstatement of cocaine seeking by nucleus accumbens AMPA.","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Suto N and Tanabe LM and Austin JD and Creekmore E and Pham CT and Vezina P","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:10:15,-1,2021-04-07 18:39:54,,,,,,,,

In Part 1, limiting the quantity of shortening provided during the 1-h period of availability attenuated subsequent 1-h shortening intake in the Intermittent access group, but had no statistically significant effect in the Daily access group. In Part 2, unrestricted availability of shortening (24 h/day-7 days/week) attenuated subsequent 1-h shortening intake in all groups. In Part 3, shortening non-availability for five weeks enhanced subsequent 1-h shortening intake in all groups. It was also shown that rats under an Intermittent, but not a Daily, schedule of access consumed as much shortening during a 1-h period of availability, as was consumed in 24 h when shortening availability was unrestricted.

In the present study we used neuroanatomical tracers to map the specific connections and topography of LP with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial agranular cortex (AGm).

We found that mLPMR consists of two distinct groups of neurons, with the more dorsal group projecting to ACC and the more ventral group projecting to AGm. This is mirrored by a similar corticothalamic topography. These findings suggest that the ventral mLPMR is specifically associated with AGm and dorsocentral striatum, while dorsal mLPMR is associated with ACC.

In contrast, elevated GluR2 decreases ICSS thresholds, an effect similar to that caused by rewarding treatments (e.g., drugs of abuse). To confirm that viral vector-mediated elevations of GluR1 in the NAc shell produce molecular consequences that are different from those of elevated GluR2, we examined the expression of a set of drug-regulated genes 3 d after treatment using quantitative PCR. Elevated GluR1 was accompanied by sustained increases in the gene for GluR1, whereas elevated GluR2 was accompanied by decreases in prodynorphin.

Recent studies show problems with alcohol and opioid dependence are associated with rapid discounting of the value of delayed outcomes. Furthermore, discounting may be particularly steep for the drug of dependence. OBJECTIVES: We determined if these findings could be extended to the behavior of cigarette smokers. In particular, we compared the discounting of hypothetical monetary outcomes by current, never, and ex-smokers of cigarettes. We also examined discounting of delayed hypothetical cigarettes by current smokers. METHODS: Current cigarette smokers (n=23), never-smokers (n=22) and ex-smokers (n=21) indicated preference for immediate versus delayed money in a titration procedure that determined indifference points at various delays. The titration procedure was repeated with cigarettes for smokers. The degree to which the delayed outcomes were discounted was estimated with two non-linear decay models: an exponential model and a hyperbolic model. RESULTS: Current smokers discounted the value of delayed money more than did the comparison groups. Never- and ex-smokers did not differ in their discounting of money. For current smokers, delayed cigarettes lost subjective value more rapidly than delayed money. The hyperbolic equation provided better fits to the data than did the exponential equation for 74 out of 89 comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking, like other forms of drug dependence, is characterized by rapid loss of subjective value for delayed outcomes, particularly for the drug of dependence. Never- and ex-smokers could discount similarly because cigarette smoking is associated with a reversible increase in discounting or due to selection bias.","Impulsivity and cigarette smoking: delay discounting in current, never, and ex-smokers.","Psychopharmacology","Bickel WK and Odum AL and Madden GJ","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:13:25,-1,2021-04-07 18:45:15,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism by which impaired dopamine neurotransmission interferes with inhibitory control is poorly understood. We had previously documented a reduction in dopamine D2 receptors in morbidly obese subjects. To assess if the reductions in dopamine D2 receptors were associated with activity in prefrontal brain regions implicated in inhibitory control we assessed the relationship between dopamine D2 receptor availability in striatum with brain glucose metabolism (marker of brain function) in ten morbidly obese subjects (BMI>40 kg/m(2)) and compared it to that in twelve non-obese controls. PET was used with [(11)C]raclopride to assess D2 receptors and with [(18)F]FDG to assess regional brain glucose metabolism. In obese subjects striatal D2 receptor availability was lower than controls and was positively correlated with metabolism in dorsolateral prefrontal, medial orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate gyrus and somatosensory cortices. In controls correlations with prefrontal metabolism were not significant but comparisons with those in obese subjects were not significant, which does not permit to ascribe the associations as unique to obesity. The associations between striatal D2 receptors and prefrontal metabolism in obese subjects suggest that decreases in striatal D2 receptors could contribute to overeating via their modulation of striatal prefrontal pathways, which participate in inhibitory control and salience attribution. The association between striatal D2 receptors and metabolism in somatosensory cortices (regions that process palatability) could underlie one of the mechanisms through which dopamine regulates the reinforcing properties of food.","Low dopamine striatal D2 receptors are associated with prefrontal metabolism in obese subjects: possible contributing factors.","NeuroImage","Volkow ND and Wang GJ and Telang F and Fowler JS and Thanos PK and Logan J and Alexoff D and Ding YS and Wong C and Ma Y and Pradhan K","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:13:29,-1,2021-04-09 15:31:17,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have shown that despite equivalent levels of psychomotor sensitization, only rats with prolonged, but not limited, access to cocaine self-administration respond to the priming effects of cocaine on drug seeking, as measured in a within-session reinstatement model of drug craving. In this model, drug seeking is first extinguished and then reinstated by non-contingent presentations of the drug alone in the absence of response-contingent stimuli. Here, we assessed the generality of this observation in rats with daily short (1 h, ShA) vs long access (6 h, LgA) to i.v. heroin self-administration. As expected, heroin intake by LgA rats (n=24) increased over time to become excessive compared to heroin intake by ShA rats (n=24). After escalation, LgA rats tended to be less sensitive to heroin-induced locomotion (7.5-30 microg, i.v.) than ShA rats. In contrast, only LgA rats, not ShA rats, responded to the priming effects of heroin, as measured by the ability of heroin alone (7.5-30 microg, i.v.) to reinstate extinguished drug-seeking behavior. Finally, during the course of heroin intake escalation, a large proportion of LgA rats developed self-injury (mostly targeting the nails and digit tips of the forepaws), a negative consequence not seen in ShA rats.

Rats were trained to self-administer heroin or cocaine (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg per infusion, i.v., respectively) for 9-12 days. Extinction sessions were given for up to 14 days, during which saline was substituted for the drugs. Tests for reinstatement were then conducted after exposure to intermittent footshock (10 or 15 min, 0.5 mA). The footshock stressor reliably reinstated extinguished cocaine- and heroin-taking behavior. Pretreatment with CP-154,526 (15 and 30 mg/kg, s.c.) significantly attenuated the reinstatement effect of the stressor in both heroin- and cocaine-trained rats.

In addition, in a separate experiment, CP-154,526 was shown not to alter high rates of lever pressing for a 10% sucrose solution, suggesting that the suppression of lever pressing in stress-induced reinstatement is not caused by a performance deficit. These results extend previous reports on the role of CRF in reinstatement of drug seeking induced by stressors.

Since drugs such as heroin, morphine, alcohol, and cannabinoids, interact with this system, there may be important common neural substrates between food and drug reward with regard to the brain's opioid systems. In this paper, we review the proposed functional role of opioid neurotransmission and mu opiate receptors within the nucleus accumbens and surrounding ventral striatum. Opioid compounds, particularly those selective for the mu receptor, induce a potent increase in food intake, sucrose, salt, saccharin, and ethanol intake. We have explored this phenomenon with regard to macronutrient selection, regional specificity, role of output structures, Fos mapping, analysis of motivational state, and enkephalin gene expression. We hypothesize that opioid-mediated mechanisms within ventral striatal medium spiny neurons mediate the affective or hedonic response to food ('liking' or food 'pleasure'). A further refinement of this hypothesis is that activation of ventral striatal opioids specifically encodes positive affect induced by tasty and/or calorically dense foods (such as sugar and fat), and promotes behaviors associated with this enhanced palatability. It is proposed that this brain mechanism was beneficial in evolutionary development for ensuring the consumption of relatively scarce, high-energy food sources. However, in modern times, with unlimited supplies of high-calorie food, it has contributed to the present epidemic of obesity.","Opioid modulation of taste hedonics within the ventral striatum.","Physiology & behavior","Kelley AE and Bakshi VP and Haber SN and Steininger TL and Will MJ and Zhang M","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:21:45,-1,2021-04-09 15:49:07,,,,,,,,

These neurobiological changes had an important behavioral influence as demonstrated by the finding that cocaine functioned as a reinforcer in subordinate but not dominant monkeys.

Although preference measures were sensitive to every budget manipulation, the nature of the changes observed were dependent upon the manner in which resource availability was manipulated and the choice alternatives offered. For example, choice was affected in an opposite manner when budget was adversely altered by lengthening choice duration ('search time') as opposed to lengthening outcome duration ('handling time'). Findings revealed partial support for pigeons' sensitivity both to changes in budget and to changes in conditioned reinforcer value.

The present study utilized a rat feeding procedure to determine if restricting access to an optional source of dietary fat would increase later consumption of that food under nonenergy-deprived conditions. Five groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were used, all of which had continuous access to a standard rodent diet and water. The control group had no access to shortening. The low-restriction group had 2-h access to shortening every day. The high-restriction group had 2-h access to shortening on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Two additional groups were switched between the high and low conditions. Two-hour and 24-h food intakes were measured every day for 6 weeks. At the end of the study rats were sacrificed and carcass composition determined. As access to the shortening decreased, consumption during the 2-h access period increased. Rats compensated for the increased shortening consumption by decreasing intake of the standard diet. Thus, cumulative energy consumption did not differ among the groups. When switched between the high and low conditions, rats rapidly adjusted to the change in shortening availability. There were no effects of access schedule on carcass composition.

RESULTS: At college entry, trauma type, frequency, and overall trauma severity were related to restricted eating, and trauma type and severity was related to binging/purging. Prospective increases in reported restricted eating were predicted by trauma type. Prospective increases in binging/purging were associated with trauma type and total trauma severity.

METHODS: Twenty-two obese (body mass index [BMI] = 36.7 +/- 6.5 SD) females (11 non-BED, 11 BED) completed the Zung depression scale and underwent the CPT, hand submerged in ice water for 2 minutes. Over 60 minutes, periodic ratings of hunger and desire to binge eat were obtained, just before blood draws for cortisol, as well as insulin. On a separate day, participants had a 1-mg oral dexamethasone suppression test (DST). RESULTS: The BED group had higher depression scores than the non-BED (p = .04), but depression was not a significant covariate for the cortisol response or to DST. After controlling for contraceptive use (n = 3), the BED group had higher basal cortisol than the non-BED group (p = .03), but cortisol did not differ after DST (p = .40). The BED group had nearly significant greater cortisol AUC after the CPT (p = .057) after controlling for insulin AUC and contraceptive use (p = .057). The BED group also had greater AUC for hunger (p = .03) and desire to binge eat (p = .02) after the CPT.

These predictions proved correct in 88% of the cases in which the analysis predicted preferences in individual subjects at specific concurrent-schedule values. These findings offer preliminary support for the position that the predictions of the demand curve analysis hold true when steady-state performances are assessed.

This effect appears to be similar to the neuroadaptation resulting from drugs of abuse and may underlay some pathological feeding behaviors. To further investigate the cellular mechanisms of these alterations, the present study used quantitative autoradiography and in situ hybridization to assess dopamine membrane transporter (DAT) protein density and mRNA expression in restricted-fed and free-fed adult male rats. The restricted feeding regimen consisted of daily limited access to either a normally preferred sucrose solution (0.3 M) or a less preferred chow in a scheduled (i.e., contingent) fashion for 7 days. Restricted-fed rats with the contingent sucrose access lost less body weight, ate more total food, and drank more fluid than free-fed, contingent food, or noncontingent controls. In addition, these animals had selectively higher DAT binding in the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area. This increase in protein binding also was accompanied by an increase in DAT mRNA levels in the ventral tegmental area. In contrast to the restricted-fed groups, no differential effect in DAT regulation was observed across free-fed groups. The observed alteration in behavior and DAT regulation suggest that neuroadaptation in the mesoaccumbens dopamine system develops in response to repeated feeding on palatable foods under dietary constraints. This supports the notion that similar cellular changes may be involved in restrictive eating disorders and bingeing.","Restricted feeding with scheduled sucrose access results in an upregulation of the rat dopamine transporter.","American journal of physiology.

Nevertheless, several studies have shown that decision-making functioning is also impaired in drug-addicted patients who have shown abnormalities in ventromedial prefrontal cortex during functional neuroimaging studies. METHODS: We assessed the decision-making function mediated by the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in 20 PG patients and 40 healthy control (HC) subjects using the Gambling Task, which simulates real-life decision-making, testing the ability to balance immediate rewards against long-term negative consequence. RESULTS: Significant differences were found in Gambling Task performance between HC subjects and PG patients, who showed a specific decision-making profile across the sequence of the game. The dissimilarity does not appear to depend on the basic cognitive function deficit of the PG group. CONCLUSIONS: These data seem to suggest the existence of a link between PG and other disorders (i.e., obsessive-compulsive disorder and drug addiction) all having diminished ability to evaluate future consequences, which may be explained at least in part by an abnormal functioning of the orbitofrontal cortex.","Frontal lobe dysfunction in pathological gambling patients.","Biological psychiatry","Cavedini P and Riboldi G and Keller R and D'Annucci A and Bellodi L","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 02:33:29,-1,2021-04-06 19:27:24,,,,,,,,

These sites are known to be important for the induction and expression, respectively, of locomotor sensitization by amphetamine. METHODS: Rats in different groups received four pairs of injections (one IC and one IP), one pair given every third day. The IC injection (0, 1 or 5 nmol/side AP-5) was administered immediately before the IP injection (saline or amphetamine, 1 mg/kg). Locomotor activity was measured following each pair of injections and again 2 weeks later when all rats were tested for sensitization following a challenge injection of amphetamine (1 mg/kg, IP). AP-5 was not administered on this test. RESULTS: As expected, rats previously exposed to amphetamine alone showed higher levels of horizontal locomotion and rearing on the test for sensitization when compared to saline pre-exposed rats. Preceding the amphetamine pre-exposure injections with infusions of AP-5 into the ventral tegmental area, but not the nucleus accumbens, dose-dependently blocked the induction of this effect. Rats previously exposed to AP-5 alone in either site did not differ significantly from saline preexposed rats on the test for sensitization.

OBJECTIVES: To explore a model of drug use in the face of adverse consequences in rats through intermittent punishment of drug seeking and to investigate whether the ability to withhold seeking responses depends upon the duration of drug history. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were trained under a seeking-taking chained schedule with sucrose or cocaine as reinforcer. Pressing the seeking lever gave access to the taking lever, and a single press on this lever delivered the reinforcer after which the seeking-taking chain recycled. During punishment, half of the seeking links terminated with a mild foot shock without access to the taking link. RESULTS: After a moderate history of reinforcement, punishment of the terminal response in the seeking link suppressed both sucrose- and cocaine-seeking responses. By contrast, rats with an extended cocaine history were more resistant to punishment than those with a moderate cocaine history. This enhanced resistance to punishment was due to a sub-group of rats that showed minimal or no suppression of drug seeking. No differences in suppression of sucrose seeking were observed in animals with moderate versus extended sucrose histories.

However, another critical factor is the temporal pattern of consumption, which in humans is characterized by intermittency, both within and between bouts of use. OBJECTIVE: To model this, we combined prolonged access to cocaine ( approximately 70 days in total) with an intermittent access (IntA) self-administration procedure and used behavioral economic indicators to quantify changes in motivation for cocaine. RESULTS: IntA produced escalation of intake, a progressive increase in cocaine demand (incentive-sensitization), and robust drug- and cue-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior. We also asked whether rats that vary in their propensity to attribute incentive salience to reward cues (sign-trackers [STs] vs. goal-trackers [GTs]) vary in the development of addiction-like behavior. Although STs were more motivated to take cocaine after limited drug experience, after IntA, STs and GTs no longer differed on any measure of addiction-like behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to large quantities of cocaine is not necessary for escalation of intake, incentive-sensitization, or other addiction-like behaviors (IntA results in far less total cocaine consumption than 'long access' procedures). Also, the ST phenotype may increase susceptibility to addiction, not because STs are inherently susceptible to incentive-sensitization (perhaps all individuals are at risk), but because this phenotype promotes continued drug use, subjecting them to incentive-sensitization. Thus, the pharmacokinetics associated with the IntA procedure are especially effective in producing a number of addiction-like behaviors and may be valuable for studying associated neuroadaptations and for assessing individual variation in vulnerability.","Less is more: prolonged intermittent access cocaine self-administration produces incentive-sensitization and addiction-like behavior.","Psychopharmacology","Kawa AB and Bentzley BS and Robinson TE","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,Drug-related intermittent or continuous access",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 14:14:01,-1,2021-03-29 16:19:43,,,,,,,,

To test this, we exposed fifty-nine healthy pre-menopausal women to both a stress session and a control session on different days. High cortisol reactors consumed more calories on the stress day compared to low reactors, but ate similar amounts on the control day. In terms of taste preferences, high reactors ate significantly more sweet food across days. Increases in negative mood in response to the stressors were also significantly related to greater food consumption.

BACKGROUND: The use of drug self-administration to study addiction is based on the assumption that drugs reinforce the behavior that results in their delivery. A wide range of drug self-administration techniques have been developed to model specific aspects of addiction. These techniques are highly amenable to being combined with a wide variety of neuroscience techniques. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of drug use as behavior that is reinforced by drugs has contributed greatly to the understanding and treatment of addiction. As part of a program of pre-clinical research that also involves screening with a variety of simpler behavioral techniques, drug self-administration procedures can provide an important last step in testing potential treatments for addiction. There is currently a concerted effort to develop self-administration procedures that model the extreme nature of the behavior engendered by addiction. As advances continue to be made in neuroscience techniques, self-administration should continue to provide a means of applying these techniques within a sophisticated and valid model of human drug addiction.","Self-administration of drugs in animals and humans as a model and an investigative tool.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)","Panlilio LV and Goldberg SR","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:10:37,-1,2021-04-07 18:40:06,,,,,,,,

To further address this issue, we compared the effects of long access (LgA) cocaine self-administration, which is widely used to model the transition to addiction, with intermittent access (IntA), which is thought to better reflect the pattern of drug use in humans, on the ability of a single, self-administered injection of cocaine to increase dopamine (DA) overflow in the core of the nucleus accumbens (using in vivo microdialysis), and to produce addiction-like behavior. IntA experience was more effective than LgA in producing addiction-like behavior-a drug experience-dependent increase in motivation for cocaine assessed using behavioral economic procedures, and cue-induced reinstatement-despite much less total drug consumption. There were no group differences in basal levels of DA in dialysate [DA], but a single self-administered IV injection of cocaine increased [DA] in the core of the nucleus accumbens to a greater extent in rats with prior IntA experience than those with LgA or limited access experience, and the latter two groups did not differ. Furthermore, high motivation for cocaine was associated with a high [DA] response. Thus, IntA, but not LgA, produced both incentive and DA sensitization. This is consistent with the notion that a hyper-responsive dopaminergic system may contribute to the transition from casual patterns of drug use to the problematic patterns that define addiction.","Incentive and dopamine sensitization produced by intermittent but not long access cocaine self-administration.","The European journal of neuroscience","Kawa AB and Valenta AC and Kennedy RT and Robinson TE","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,Drug-related intermittent or continuous access",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 14:23:55,-1,2021-03-29 16:20:31,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that caloric restriction and stress interact in a unique manner to promote binge eating. To test this hypothesis, a group of young female rats were cycled through a restriction period (4 days of 66% of control food intake) followed by 6 days of free feeding prior to being stressed by acute foot shock. After three of these cycles, the food intake of rats exposed only to restriction (R), or only to stress (S), did not differ from controls. However, R+S rats that were restricted and refed, despite normal body weight and food intake after free feeding, engaged in a powerful bout of hyperphagia when stressed (Experiment 1). The R + S effect was replicated in an older group of rats (Experiment 2). The hyperphagia was characteristically binge-like, it constituted a 40% selective increase in highly palatable (HP) food (P < .001) over a discrete period of time (within 24 h post-stress), and reflected feeding for reward (higher HP:chow ratio) over metabolic need as occurred after restriction (higher chow:HP ratio). Subsequent experiments revealed that binge eating did not occur if only chow was available (Experiment 3) or if restriction-refeeding (R-R) did not proximally precede stress (Experiment 4). Experiment 5 revealed that a history of R-R cycles followed by only one stress episode was sufficient to increase intake to 53% above controls as early as 2 h after stress (P < .001). This animal model of binge eating should facilitate investigations into the neurochemical changes induced by dieting and environmental stress to produce disordered eating and provide a preclinical tool to test preventive strategies and treatments more relevant to bulimia nervosa, multiple cases of binge eating disorder (BED) and binge-purge type anorexia nervosa.","A new animal model of binge eating: key synergistic role of past caloric restriction and stress.","Physiology & behavior","Hagan MM and Wauford PK and Chandler PC and Jarrett LA and Rybak RJ and Blackburn K","",-1,2021-04-11 19:31:27,0,2021-03-28 14:42:41,-1,2021-04-03 21:37:38,,,,,,,,

It appears that the stimulus that predicts 10 pellets acts as a strong conditioned reinforcer, despite the fact that the stimulus that predicts 0 pellets occurs 4 times as often. In the present research, we tested the hypothesis that early in training conditioned inhibition develops to the 0-pellet stimulus, but later in training it dissipates. We trained pigeons with a hue as the 10-pellet stimulus and a vertical line as the 0-pellet stimulus.

Taste plays a role in the regulation of appetite and the purpose of the current study was to determine whether bulimic women have alterations in the physiologic response to the blind administration of glucose. METHOD: To avoid the confounding effects of a current eating disorder, and to assess possibly trait-related disturbances, we studied 10 subjects recovered (> or = 1 year) from a bulimic-type eating disorder and 6 control women. Subjects were administered a solution of glucose or artificial saliva (control solution) in alternating blocks during a functional magnet resonance imaging scan. RESULTS: Individuals who recovered from a bulimic-type eating disorder had significantly lower activation in the right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] coordinates x = 8, y = 22, z = 28; cluster size = 18 voxels, T = 5.11, Z-score = 3.78) and in the left cuneus (occipital cortex; MNI coordinates x = -12, y = -78, z = 10; cluster size = 21 voxels, T = 4.27, Z-score = 3.36), when glucose was compared with artificial saliva.

Growing evidence suggests that these behaviors warrant consideration as nonsubstance or 'behavioral' addictions and has led to the newly introduced diagnostic category 'Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders' in DSM-5. At present, only gambling disorder has been placed in this category, with insufficient data for other proposed behavioral addictions to justify their inclusion. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of behavioral addictions, describes treatment considerations, and addresses future directions. Current evidence points to overlaps between behavioral and substance-related addictions in phenomenology, epidemiology, comorbidity, neurobiological mechanisms, genetic contributions, responses to treatments, and prevention efforts.

For example, these alterations have strongly emphasized the physiological differences between the homeostatic and the hedonic regulation of food intake--the latter being largely responsible for the pronounced increase in obesity in the past few decades. There is also increasing agreement that compulsive overeating shares many parallels with addiction disorders such as drug abuse. These factors have also fostered a renewed interest in identifying individual differences in personality and motivational systems that increase the risk for overeating and weight gain in our population. Reward sensitivity has been the focus of a recent body of compelling research, with evidence favoring two seemingly opposite points of view. On the one hand, studies have found support for a link between low reward sensitivity and obesity, whereas other evidence suggests that a strong appetitive motivation leads to overeating and weight gain. Arguments are provided to reconcile these apparently disparate theories. Finally, the role of impulsivity and its links with symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder are discussed, as well as their respective roles in the risk profile for obesity.","Psychobiological traits in the risk profile for overeating and weight gain.","International journal of obesity (2005)","Davis C","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 02:16:02,-1,2021-04-06 19:11:08,,,,,,,,

We studied the metabolic changes and food-motivated behavior when rats were subjected to a choice diet with chow, lard and a 30% sucrose solution (high fat high sugar (HFHS)-choice diet). Because rats showed considerable variations in the feeding response to HFHS-choice diet and in food-motivated behavior, we investigated whether the motivation to obtain a sucrose reward correlated with the development of obesity when rats were subsequently subjected to HFHS-choice diet. METHOD: We first studied feeding, locomotor activity and body temperature, fat weights and hormonal concentrations when male Wistar rats were subjected to HFHS-choice diet for 1 week. Second, we studied sucrose-motivated behavior, using a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement in rats that were subjected to the HFHS-choice diet for at least 2 weeks, compared to control rats on a chow diet. Third, we measured motivation for sucrose under a PR schedule of reinforcement in rats that were subsequently subjected to HFHS-choice diet or a chow diet for 4 weeks. Fat weights were measured and correlated with the motivation to obtain sucrose pellets. RESULTS: One week on the HFHS-choice diet increased plasma concentrations of glucose and leptin, increased fat stores, but did not alter body temperature or locomotor activity. Moreover, consuming the HFHS-choice diet for several weeks increased the motivation to work for sucrose pellets. Furthermore, the motivation to obtain sucrose pellets correlated positively with abdominal fat stores in rats subsequently subjected to the HFHS-choice diet, whereas this correlation was not found in rats fed on a chow diet. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the motivation to respond for palatable food correlates with obesity due to an obesogenic environment. Conversely, the HFHS-choice diet, which results in obesity, also increased the motivation to work for sucrose. Thus, being motivated to work for sucrose results in obesity, which, in turn, increases food-motivated behavior, resulting in a vicious circle of food motivation and obesity.","A reciprocal interaction between food-motivated behavior and diet-induced obesity.","International journal of obesity (2005)","la Fleur SE and Vanderschuren LJ and Luijendijk MC and Kloeze BM and Tiesjema B and Adan RA","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups,No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc),no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 14:01:54,-1,2021-03-29 16:54:46,,,,,,,,

However, it remains unclear whether BED represents an etiologically distinct behavioral phenotype of obesity or simply a nonspecific eating pattern sometimes seen in obese individuals. OBJECTIVE: To test whether BED aggregates in families independently of obesity, and if so, whether familial factors for BED also independently increase the risk of obesity. DESIGN, PATIENTS, AND SETTING: Blinded family interview study of overweight or obese probands with (n = 150) and without (n = 150) BED, and their first-degree relatives (n = 888) in a community setting evaluated between October 2002 and July 2004. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime diagnosis of BED; current and highest lifetime body mass index (calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters). RESULTS: Binge-eating disorder aggregated strongly in families independently of obesity (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-3.6; P<.001). Furthermore, relatives of probands with BED displayed a markedly higher prevalence of severe obesity in adulthood (body mass index >/=40) than relatives of probands without BED even when controlling for proband body mass index (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-4.4; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Binge-eating disorder is a familial disorder caused in part by factors distinct from other familial factors for obesity. Furthermore, these BED-specific familial factors may independently increase the risk of obesity, especially severe obesity. It follows that targeted interventions capable of preventing or treating traits influenced by these BED-specific familial factors could reduce the public health burden of obesity.","Binge-eating disorder as a distinct familial phenotype in obese individuals.","Archives of general psychiatry","Hudson JI and Lalonde JK and Berry JM and Pindyck LJ and Bulik CM and Crow SJ and McElroy SL and Laird NM and Tsuang MT and Walsh BT and Rosenthal NR and Pope HG Jr","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 02:18:54,-1,2021-04-06 19:21:57,,,,,,,,

Forbidden foods were also found to have a higher caloric density (p less than 0.000). Analyses of 11 days of 24-hour food intake records found that 69% of binge eating episodes consisted of forbidden foods, compared to 15% of episodes classified by subjects as nonbinge intervals. These results are consistent with previous studies describing nutrient content of alternating bouts of overconsumption and dietary restraint.

First, microdialysis was performed in the nucleus accumbens (NAC) at 20 min intervals during free feeding in rats at 80% of normal body weight. Extracellular concentration of dopamine (DA), dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and homovanillic acid (HVA) increased significantly during eating indicating an increase in DA turnover. Second, microdialysis samples were collected from the NAC during bar pressing with a) a signal light on and food available, b) the light on but no food available, c) neither light nor food. Only when food was available did extracellular DA, DOPAC and HVA increase significantly. This increase in DA turnover occurred in the accumbens but not in the ventral striatum. Third, electrical stimulation of the perifornical lateral hypothalamus (LH) that was capable of inducing feeding increased extracellular DA, DOPAC and HVA in the NAC. This occurred whether the animal had food to eat or not. The effect of LH stimulation on DA turnover resembled the effects of free feeding and operant feeding in Experiments 1 and 2. Perifornical LH stimulation did not increase dopamine turnover in the ventral striatum. The results show that perifornical LH stimulation activates the mesolimbic dopamine system and that dopamine release in the accumbens is involved in feeding. The increase in dopamine turnover outlasted the consummatory act. This suggests that accumbens dopamine may be related to sensory input, feeding reflexes, food reward or memory processes and not just to the consummatory act itself.","Feeding and hypothalamic stimulation increase dopamine turnover in the accumbens.","Physiology & behavior","Hernandez L and Hoebel BG","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:22:16,-1,2021-04-09 15:49:56,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: In the present review, we focus on two facets of impulsivity (and tasks that measure them): (1) impulsive choice (delay discounting task) and (2) inhibitory failure (go/no-go, stop signal reaction time, and five-choice serial reaction time tasks). We also describe how performance on each of these tasks is associated with drug-related behavior during phases of drug abuse that capture the essential features of addiction (acquisition, escalation, and reinstatement of drug-seeking after drug access has terminated). Three hypotheses (H) regarding the relationship between impulsivity and drug abuse are discussed: (1) increased levels of impulsivity lead to drug abuse (H1), (2) drugs of abuse increase impulsivity (H2), and (3) impulsivity and drug abuse are associated through a common third factor (H3). CONCLUSION: Impulsivity expressed as impulsive choice or inhibitory failure plays a role in several key transition phases of drug abuse. There is evidence to support all three nonexclusive hypotheses. Increased levels of impulsivity lead to acquisition of drug abuse (H1) and subsequent escalation or dysregulation of drug intake. Drugs of abuse may increase impulsivity (H2), which is an additional contributor to escalation/dysregulation. Abstinence, relapse, and treatment may be influenced by both H1 and H2. In addition, there is a relationship between impulsivity and other drug abuse vulnerability factors, such as sex, hormonal status, reactivity to nondrug rewards, and early environmental experiences that may impact drug intake during all phases of addiction (H3). Relating drug abuse and impulsivity in phases of addiction via these three hypotheses provides a heuristic model from which future experimental questions can be addressed.","The role of impulsive behavior in drug abuse.","Psychopharmacology","Perry JL and Carroll ME","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:29:07,-1,2021-04-09 15:53:31,,,,,,,,

Exposing animals to this drug either systemically or in the cell body region of these neurons in the ventral tegmental area leads to long-lasting alterations in dopaminergic function. These have most often been assessed as increased locomotor activity and enhanced DA overflow in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) after re-exposure to the drug weeks to months later. Evidence is presented showing that manipulations that produce this sensitization of midbrain DA neuron reactivity enhance the pursuit and self-administration of psychostimulant drugs. Procedures known to prevent the induction of sensitization by amphetamine also prevent the facilitation of drug taking. Enhanced drug self-administration and primed reinstatement of drug seeking are also accompanied by enhanced NAcc DA reactivity. Finally, drugs that increase NAcc DA overflow acutely but fail to produce sensitization of this effect are not associated with the subsequent enhancement of self-administration. These results indicate a direct relationship between the sensitization of midbrain dopamine neuron reactivity and the excessive pursuit and self-administration of psychostimulant drugs. Understanding the neuronal events and adaptations that underlie the induction and expression of sensitization may thus help elucidate how drug abuse develops, how it is reinstated and ultimately how both may be prevented.","Sensitization of midbrain dopamine neuron reactivity and the self-administration of psychomotor stimulant drugs.","Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews","Vezina P","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 14:52:55,-1,2021-04-11 19:27:44,,,,,,,,

Mouse models of binge-like eating behavior are lacking making it difficult to employ genetic models in the identification of mechanisms regulating excessive eating. We report a rapid and simple model to induce binge-like eating behavior in mice that does not require food deprivation or exogenous stressors. Weekly 24 h access to a nutritionally complete high energy diet (HED), along with continuous access to standard chow, resulted in a significant increase in HED intake following its presentation compared to mice that had continuous access to both diets. Mice exhibiting binge-like eating consumed one-third of their normal total daily caloric intake within 2.5 h of HED presentation. Moreover, total 24-h caloric intakes were increased by 50% in mice exhibiting binge-like eating. Following repeated cycles, binge-like eating of the HED was maintained over several weeks with no evidence of habituation or significant alterations in body weight and adiposity. Pharmacological evaluation of binge-like eating behavior was performed using clinically employed compounds. Interestingly, binge-like eating was dose-dependently decreased by fluoxetine, but not baclofen or topiramate. These data support clinical validation of this mouse model of binge-like eating behavior, as fluoxetine has been shown to reduce binge frequency in human subjects with BED. The availability of transgenic and knockout mice will allow for the determination of genes that are involved in the initiation and maintenance of binge-like eating behavior.","A model of binge-like eating behavior in mice that does not require food deprivation or stress.","Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)","Czyzyk TA and Sahr AE and Statnick MA","",1,2021-03-29 17:44:32,1,2021-03-28 14:19:23,-1,2021-03-29 16:55:42,,,,,,,,

Predictive association of an otherwise neutral stimulus extrinsic to Fonzies (empty plastic box) with Fonzies feeding resulted in the acquisition by the stimulus of the property to elicit incentive responses directed toward the stimulus and to increase extracellular DA in the PFCX. However, the same stimulus, or a more complex stimulus including intrinsic stimuli (Fonzies-filled plastic box), failed to acquire the ability to modify extracellular DA in the NAc. Pseudoconditioning, i.e., nonpredictive association of the extrinsic stimulus (empty box) with Fonzies feeding, did not result in acquisition by the stimulus of the property to elicit incentive responses and to increase extracellular DA in the PFCX. Repeated nonreinforced presentation of previously conditioned extrinsic stimuli (empty box) resulted in extinction of the property to elicit incentive responses and to increase extracellular DA in the PFCX.

In a typical reinstatement experiment, previously drug-trained rats undergo extinction during which responding is no longer followed by drug delivery. After significant extinction is observed, rats are then exposed to an event expected to reinstate drug-seeking behavior. Using this procedure, it has been recently reported that footshock stress leads to reinstatement of drug-seeking in heroin-trained, presently drug-free rats. The purpose of the present study was to assess the generality of this effect of stress. Here we report that 15 min of intermittent footshock (0.86 mA; 0.5 s on, with a mean off period of 40 s) reinstated selectively cocaine-seeking behavior after 14 extinction sessions (rats were previously trained on a FR1 TO 20 s to obtain cocaine at a dose of 0.25 mg/infusion). In contrast, under similar experimental conditions, the same stressor did not reinstate food-seeking in food-trained rats after seven extinction sessions (rats were previously trained on a FR1 TO 20 s to obtain six food pellets). Rather, when the basal level of responding was sufficiently high, footshock stress induced a significant suppression of the instrumental performance.

Here, we review briefly the history of the model and describe the different procedures that have been used to study the phenomenon of reinstatement of drug seeking. The results from studies using pharmacological and neuroanatomical techniques to determine the neuronal events that mediate reinstatement of heroin, cocaine and alcohol seeking by acute priming injections of drugs, drug-associated cues and environmental stressors are summarized. In addition, several issues are discussed, including (1) the concordance between the neuronal mechanisms involved in drug-induced reinstatement and those involved in drug reward and discrimination, (2) the role of drug withdrawal states and periods in reinstatement of drug seeking, (3) the role of neuronal adaptations induced by exposure to drugs in relapse, and (4) the degree to which the rat reinstatement model provides a suitable preclinical model of relapse to drug taking. CONCLUSIONS: The data derived from studies using the reinstatement model suggest that the neuronal events that mediate drug-, cue- and stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking are not identical, that the mechanisms underlying drug-induced reinstatement are to some degree different from those mediating drug discrimination or reward, and that the duration of the withdrawal period following cocaine and heroin self-administration has a profound effect on reinstatement induced by drug cues and stress.

OBJECTIVES: The goal was to test the hypothesis that acute nicotine decreases extracellular ACh and increases extracellular dopamine (DA) in the NAc, while withdrawal from nicotine causes an opposite neurochemical imbalance with high extracellular ACh and low DA. METHODS: Rats were prepared with a microdialysis probe in the NAc (primarily the shell region). They received one injection of nicotine (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) or chronic nicotine (9 mg/kg per day via osmotic minipump). RESULTS: Naive animals receiving acute nicotine showed a mild, significant increase in both ACh (122% of baseline) and DA (124%). After chronic nicotine administration for 7 days, the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine (1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) precipitated withdrawal with the appearance of somatic signs (teeth chattering and shakes/tremors) and a significant increase in extracellular ACh to 125% of baseline, while extracellular DA decreased to 65%. Control groups receiving saline in place of nicotine or mecamylamine did not show these effects. CONCLUSIONS: Earlier work suggests that the observed release of accumbens ACh and DA in response to acute nicotine administration may be a factor in nicotine-induced suppression of appetite. ACh release during withdrawal, coupled with the decrease in extracellular DA may play a role in the aversive aspects of nicotine withdrawal that contribute to dependency.","Effects of nicotine and mecamylamine-induced withdrawal on extracellular dopamine and acetylcholine in the rat nucleus accumbens.","Psychopharmacology","Rada P and Jensen K and Hoebel BG","Drug-related intermittent or continuous access",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:16:18,-1,2021-04-07 18:46:50,,,,,,,,

Apart from metabolic factors, obesity is caused by overeating. Clinical reports have led to the suggestion that some individuals may develop addictive-like behaviours when consuming palatable foods, and compulsive eating plays a similar dominant role in obesity as compulsive drug taking does in drug addiction. The progress made in the development of treatment strategies for obesity is limited, in part, because the physiological and neurological causes and consequences of compulsive eating behaviour are not clearly understood and cannot readily be studied in human subjects. We have developed experimental approaches that reflect the functioning of the components of eating control, including compulsive food taking in rats. Rats that are given free choice between standard chow and a palatable, chocolate-containing 'Cafeteria Diet' (CD) develop distinct signs of compulsive food taking that appear at an early stage. These include the inability to adapt intake behaviour in periods of limited or bitter-tasting CD access, continued food intake during resting phases and changes in fine structure of feeding (duration, distribution and recurrence of feeding bouts). The model will help examine the neurobiological underpinnings of compulsive food seeking and food taking and provides a possibility to study the effects of novel anti-obesity compounds on compulsive eating and other components of food-taking behaviour in detail.

The NHSDA included items to assess seven clinical features often associated with cocaine dependence, which were used in latent class modeling.

OBJECTIVES: We studied individual differences in Pavlovian conditioned approach behavior and examined the expression of neurobiological markers associated with the dopaminergic system, the same neural system implicated in incentive motivational processes. METHODS: Pavlovian autoshaping procedures consisted of the brief presentation of an illuminated retractable lever (conditioned stimulus) followed by the response-independent delivery of a food pellet (unconditioned stimulus), which lead to a Pavlovian conditioned response. In situ hybridization was performed on brains obtained either following the first or last (fifth) day of training. RESULTS: Two phenotypes emerged. Sign-trackers (ST) exhibited behavior that seemed to be largely controlled by the cue that signaled impending reward delivery; whereas goal-trackers (GT) preferentially approached the location where the reward was delivered. Following a single training session, ST showed greater expression of dopamine D1 receptor mRNA relative to GT. After 5 days of training, GT exhibited greater expression levels of tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine transporter, and dopamine D2 receptor mRNA relative to ST. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the development of approach behavior towards signals vs goal leads to distinct adaptations in the dopamine system. The sign-tracker vs goal-tracker phenotype may prove to be a valuable animal model to investigate individual differences in the way incentive salience is attributed to environmental stimuli, which may contribute to the development of addiction and other compulsive behavioral disorders.","Individual differences in the propensity to approach signals vs goals promote different adaptations in the dopamine system of rats.","Psychopharmacology","Flagel SB and Watson SJ and Robinson TE and Akil H","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc)",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 02:18:30,-1,2021-04-06 19:21:47,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have characterized the main mechanisms of its depolarization-induced release from rat purified cerebrocortical synaptosomes in superfusion and compared them with those of the well known excitatory neurotransmitter L-glutamate. High KCl and 4-aminopyridine were used as depolarizing agents. At 15 mM KCl, the overflows of both transmitters were almost completely dependent on external Ca2+. At 35 and 50 mM KCl, the overflows of L-aspartate, but not those of L-glutamate, became sensitive to DL-threo-b-benzyloxy aspartic acid (DL-TBOA), an excitatory amino acid transporter inhibitor. In the presence of DL-TBOA, the 50 mM KCl-evoked release of L-aspartate was still largely external Ca2+-dependent. The DL-TBOA insensitive,external Ca2+-independent component of the 50 mM KCl-evoked overflows of L-aspartate and L-glutamate was significantly decreased by the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger blocker CGP 37157. The Ca2+-dependent, KCl-evoked overflows of L-aspartate and L-glutamate were diminished by botulinum neurotoxin C, although to a significantly different extent. The 4-aminopyridine-induced L-aspartate and L-glutamate release was completely external Ca2+-dependent and never affected by DL-TBOA. Superimposable results have been obtained by pre-labeling synaptosomes with [3H]D aspartate and [3H]L-glutamate. Therefore, our data showing that L-aspartate is released from nerve terminals by calcium dependent,exocytotic mechanisms support the neurotransmitter role of this amino acid.","L-aspartate as an amino acid neurotransmitter: mechanisms of the depolarization-induced release from cerebrocortical synaptosomes.","Journal of neurochemistry","Cavallero A and Marte A and Fedele E","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:14:00,-1,2021-04-09 15:31:33,,,,,,,,

Patients were interviewed with structured diagnostic interviews and were queried regarding history of overweight, dieting, and binge eating behaviors. Questionnaires were also administered to assess current eating disturbances, body dissatisfaction, and general functioning. Participants were classified as Overweight First, Binge First, or Diet First, and the three groups were compared on developmental sequence and using the battery of measures. RESULTS: Sixty-three percent of the 284 participants reported becoming overweight prior to the onset of dieting or binge eating. Participants who reported they were overweight first had significantly greater BMI at the time of assessment. The 16% of the participants who reported binge eating first were significantly younger at the onset of BED diagnosis and reported significantly less dietary restraint.

DESIGN, MEASURES AND SETTING: A 2 x 3 experimental design in a laboratory setting employed factors of gambler type (regular, non-regular) and prior mood (happy, neutral, depressed). Measures were number of trials played on a gambling game, and mood ratings (post-mood induction, during and after play). PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Sixty regular and 60 non-regular gamblers (all male students) were assigned randomly to watch a video inducing one of the three mood conditions. They were then given AUD$10.00 to gamble in a computerized card-cutting game. FINDINGS: AIM predictions were supported: prior mood did not affect gaming persistence for regular gamblers, but non-regulars showed reduced persistence across happy, neutral and depressed moods. After-play mood ratings were related to winnings for regulars, and losing regulars were significantly more unhappy after-play compared to during-play, and compared to both their winning counterparts and non-regulars. Mood and winnings were unrelated for non-regulars, with little during- to after-play mood change. CONCLUSIONS: The findings speak to depression as a causal factor in addictive gambling. Depressed mood did not enhance persistence in regular gamblers, but rather failed to have the inhibitory effect observed in non-regular gamblers. Evidence of mood changes during gambling was obtained, although multiple measures (self-report, physiological indicators, anticipated states) of both affective valence and arousal are advocated for future studies.","Induced mood and persistence at gaming.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)","Hills AM and Hill S and Mamone N and Dickerson M","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:11:43,-1,2021-04-07 18:40:28,,,,,,,,

To confirm and extend results obtained in the few preclinical and clinical studies available in English language journals, the purpose of the present study was to re-investigate the effects produced by a single oral administration of an R. rosea hydroalcohol extract (containing 3% rosavin and 1% salidroside) on the central nervous system in mice. The extract was tested on antidepressant, adaptogenic, anxiolytic, nociceptive and locomotor activities at doses of 10, 15 and 20 mg/kg, using predictive behavioural tests and animal models. The results show that this R. rosea extract significantly, but not dose-dependently, induced antidepressant-like, adaptogenic, anxiolytic-like and stimulating effects in mice. This study thus provides evidence of the efficacy of R. rosea extracts after a single administration, and confirms many preclinical and clinical studies indicating the adaptogenic and stimulating effects of such R. rosea extracts.

Rats were allowed to self-administer cocaine intravenously for prolonged periods of time and their brain reward thresholds were then assessed using intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) thresholds. ICSS thresholds were used operationally as a measure of the animals' 'hedonic-anhedonic' state. It was found that during cocaine withdrawal ICSS thresholds were elevated compared to predrug baseline levels and to control animals' thresholds, reflecting an 'anhedonic' state. The magnitude and duration of the 'anhedonic' state was proportional to the amount of cocaine consumed during the binge. A measure of response latency provided evidence that this postcocaine elevation of thresholds is due to a desensitization of the reward pathways mediating ICSS reward and not to any nonspecific (e.g., performance) effects of the cocaine exposure.","Postcocaine anhedonia.

Rats were administered five injections of either AMPH (1.5mg/kg, i.p.) or saline, one injection every 2-3 days. Fourteen days following the last injection, they were trained to self-administer AMPH (200 microg/kg/infusion, i.v.) first on fixed ratio schedules (FR) and then on a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement (PR). As expected, AMPH-exposed rats worked harder and obtained significantly more drug infusions than saline-exposed rats on the PR schedule. After 4 days of stable responding, all rats were bilaterally microinjected with KN-93 (1 or 10 nmol/0.5 microl/side) into the NAcc shell, 2 min prior to the beginning of the self-administration session. Inhibiting CaMKII in this site reduced the enhanced drug intake observed in AMPH-exposed rats to levels no longer significantly different from those of saline-exposed rats. Responding in these latter controls was not affected by KN-93 nor did KN-93 affect responding in AMPH-exposed rats when it was infused into the NAcc core. Thus, in a manner similar to what has been reported for sensitized locomotion and NAcc DA overflow, these results suggest that inhibiting CaMKII in the NAcc shell attenuates the enhanced motivation to obtain a drug reinforcer that is normally displayed in AMPH-exposed rats.","Inhibition of CaMKII in the nucleus accumbens shell decreases enhanced amphetamine intake in sensitized rats.","Neuroscience letters","Loweth JA and Baker LK and Guptaa T and Guillory AM and Vezina P","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 02:19:56,-1,2021-04-06 19:22:56,,,,,,,,

Brain sites involved in the production of physical dependence on opiates are anatomically distinct from those initiating the acutely rewarding action of opiates. It is theoretically viable that opiates derive their reinforcing impact from a combination of positive and negative reinforcement processes: (a) the neural substrate for the positive reinforcing action probably involves a ventral tegmental dopamine system important in appetitive motivation, and (b) the neural substrate for the negative reinforcing action may involve a periventricular gray system that is independent of the system which mediates the acutely rewarding property of opiates.","Neural substrates of opiate reinforcement.","Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry","Bozarth MA and Wise RA","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:14:53,-1,2021-04-07 18:46:01,,,,,,,,

Few laboratory studies examining pramipexole's effects on gambling-like behavior have been conducted. OBJECTIVES: The present study used a rodent model approximating some aspects of human gambling to examine within-subject effects of acute pramipexole (0.03, 0.1, 0.18, and 0.3 mg/kg) on rat's choices to earn food reinforcement by completing variable-ratio (VR; i.e., gambling-like) or fixed-ratio (FR) response requirements. RESULTS: In a condition in which the VR alternative was rarely selected, all but the lowest dose of pramipexole significantly increased choice of the VR alternative (an average of 15% above saline). The same doses did not affect choice significantly in a control condition designed to evaluate the involvement of nonspecific drug effects. Pramipexole increased latencies to initiate trials (+9.12 s) and to begin response runs on forced-choice trials (VR = +0.21 s; FR = +0.88 s), but did not affect measures of response perseveration (conditional probabilities of 'staying'). CONCLUSIONS: The findings are consistent with clinical reports linking pramipexole to the expression of increased gambling in humans. Results are discussed in the context of neurobehavioral evidence suggesting that dopamine agonists increase sensitivity to reward delay and disrupt appropriate feedback from negative outcomes.","Effects of acute pramipexole on preference for gambling-like schedules of reinforcement in rats.","Psychopharmacology","Johnson PS and Madden GJ and Brewer AT and Pinkston JW and Fowler SC","",-1,2021-04-11 19:31:41,0,2021-03-28 14:40:48,-1,2021-04-03 21:18:58,,,,,,,,

We tested the hypothesis that context cues surrounding palatable food (PF) intake have the power to disrupt caloric regulation even of less PF. Context cues are non-food cues that are in the environment where PF is habitually eaten. DESIGN: Rats were conditioned to associate intake of Oreo cookies as the PF to cages with distinct context cues that differed from cues in cages where they were only given chow. PF naturally stimulated greater caloric intake. The rats were then tested in the PF cage with only chow available to determine whether the PF-paired cues, alone, could elicit overeating of plain chow. SUBJECTS: Non-food-deprived female Sprague-Dawley rats. MEASUREMENTS: Intake of plain chow under PF-paired cues vs chow-paired cues was compared. This was also measured in tests that included a morsel of PF as a priming stimulus. We also controlled for any effect of binge-prone vs binge-resistant status to predict cued-overeating. RESULTS: Rats consumed significantly more chow when exposed to context cues paired earlier with PF than with chow (P<0.01). This effect occurred using various cues (for example, different types of bedding or wallpaper). The effect was strengthened by priming with a morsel of PF (P<0.001) and was unaffected by baseline differences in propensity to binge on PF. CONCLUSION: Context-cues associated with PF intake can drive overeating even of a less PF and abolish the ability of rats to compensate for the calories of a PF primer. Just as drug-associated context cues can reinstate drug-addiction relapse, PF-paired cues may trigger overeating relapses linked to weight regain and obesity. This model should help identify the reflex-like biology that sabotages attempts to adhere to healthy reduced calorie regimens and call greater attention to the cue-factor in the treatment of binge eating and obesity.","The Pavlovian power of palatable food: lessons for weight-loss adherence from a new rodent model of cue-induced overeating.","International journal of obesity (2005)","Boggiano MM and Dorsey JR and Thomas JM and Murdaugh DL","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 14:20:02,-1,2021-03-29 17:03:12,,,,,,,,

Here we assess the response of the human brain to the presentation of appetitive food stimuli during food presentation using PET and FDG. METHOD: Metabolic changes in response to food presentation were done in 12 healthy normal body weight subjects who were food deprived before the study. RESULTS: Food presentation significantly increased metabolism in the whole brain (24%, P < 0.01) and these changes were largest in superior temporal, anterior insula, and orbitofrontal cortices. The increases in the right orbitofrontal cortex were the ones that correlated significantly with the increases in self-reports of hunger and desire for food. DISCUSSION: The marked increase in brain metabolism by the presentation of food provides evidence of the high sensitivity of the human brain to food stimuli. This high sensitivity coupled with the ubiquitousness of food stimuli in the environment is likely to contribute to the epidemic of obesity. In particular, the activation of the right orbitofrontal cortex, a brain region involved with drive, may underlie the motivation to procure food, which may be subjectively experienced as 'desire for food' and 'hunger' when exposed to food stimuli.","Exposure to appetitive food stimuli markedly activates the human brain.","NeuroImage","Wang GJ and Volkow ND and Telang F and Jayne M and Ma J and Rao M and Zhu W and Wong CT and Pappas NR and Geliebter A and Fowler JS","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:23:56,-1,2021-04-09 15:51:03,,,,,,,,

The most sensitive sites for these opioid effects in rodents are in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg). Opioid inhibition of GABA neurons in these sites is hypothesized to lead to arousing and rewarding effects through disinhibition of VTA DA neurons. We review findings that the laterodorsal tegmental (LDTg) and pedunculopontine tegmental (PPTg) nuclei, which each contain cholinergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic cells, are important for these effects. LDTg and/or PPTg cholinergic inputs to VTA mediate opioid-induced locomotion and DA activation via VTA M5 muscarinic receptors. LDTg and/or PPTg cholinergic inputs to RMTg also modulate opioid-induced locomotion. Lesions or inhibition of LDTg or PPTg neurons reduce morphine-induced increases in forebrain DA release, acquisition of morphine CPP or self-administration.

Here, we used positron emission tomography (PET) and [18F] deoxyglucose to compare the brain metabolic responses (marker of brain function) of cocaine-addicted subjects (n = 21) and controls (n = 15) to identify brain regions that are uniquely activated in addicted subjects by intravenous methylphenidate (a drug that cocaine-addicted subjects report to be similar to cocaine). In parallel, we also measured the changes in dopamine (DA) induced by intravenous methylphenidate (using PET and [11C] raclopride) in the striatum and in the thalamus. Metabolic responses between groups differed significantly only in the right medial orbital prefrontal cortex [Brodmann's area (BA) 25 and medial BA 11], where methylphenidate increased metabolism in addicted subjects but decreased metabolism in controls. These changes were associated in all subjects with increased 'desire for methylphenidate' and in the addicted subjects with 'cocaine craving.' In addicted subjects, increases in BA 25 were also associated with mood elevation. Methylphenidate-induced increases in metabolism in the medial orbital prefrontal cortex were associated with its increase of DA in the thalamus but not in the striatum. These findings provide evidence that enhanced sensitivity of BA 25 (region involved with emotional reactivity) and BA 11 (region involved with salience attribution and motivation) in cocaine-addicted subjects may underlie the strong emotional response to the drug and the intense desire to procure it that results in craving and compulsive drug intake.

These results, in conjunction with recent results on humans, are interpreted to represent a distinction between food rejection based primarily on unpalatability (distaste) and food rejection based primarily on anticipated negative consequences of ingestion (danger). The results also support the hypothesis that upper gastrointestinal distress (most probably nausea) plays a special role in negative palatability shifts (acquired distastes). These results have implications for the understanding of predispositions in learning and suggest important differences in the quality (readout) of different types of associations.

Therefore, we studied effects of weight loss on neurochemistry of a brain mechanism involved in behavior reinforcement.

No such change was observed in dorsal striatum (STR) or medial prefrontal cortex. In underweight rats, systemic amphetamine (1.5 mg/kg i.p.) transiently restored extracellular DA, but only to basal normal levels. Morphine (20 mg/kg i.p.) or a meal also increased DA, but the percent increase was significantly smaller in underweight than normal weight animals. Amphetamine infused locally by reverse dialysis in the NAC increased extracellular DA more in underweight animals than controls, suggesting that DA had accumulated in the presynaptic terminals. This was confirmed by finding significantly more DA in homogenized NAC micropunches of underweight rats. Receptor counts in micropunches and quantitative receptor autoradiography showed 3H-SCH23390 and 3H-spiperone D1- and D2-type binding in the NAC, STR, frontal cortex and hypothalamus did not change significantly. Locomotor activity was depressed suggesting that low DA release in the NAC may be related to energy conservation during weight loss. Low extracellular DA may also underlie the increase in food and drug intake typically observed in underweight animals and humans when they attempt to restore extracellular DA levels by natural or artificial means.","Restricted eating with weight loss selectively decreases extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and alters dopamine response to amphetamine, morphine, and food intake.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Pothos EN and Creese I and Hoebel BG","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:06:18,-1,2021-04-07 18:07:37,,,,,,,,

Palatable food also releases accumbens-shell DA, but in naive rats the effect can wane during a long meal and disappears with repetition. Under select dietary circumstances, sugar can have effects similar to a drug of abuse. Rats show signs of DA sensitization and opioid dependence when given intermittent access to sucrose, such as alterations in DA and mu-opioid receptors, cross-sensitization with amphetamine and alcohol, and behavioral and neurochemical signs of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. The present experiment asks whether sucrose-dependent rats release DA each time they binge. We also predict that acetylcholine (ACh), which rises as the end of a meal, will be delayed in rats with intermittent access to sucrose. To create dependency, the experimental group (Daily Intermittent Sucrose) was maintained on a diet of 12-h food deprivation that extended 4 h into the dark, followed by 12-h access to a 10% sucrose solution and chow, daily, for 21 days. As the main result, these rats gradually increased their sucrose intake from 37 to 112 ml per day (from 13 to 20 ml in the first hour of access), and repeatedly increased extracellular DA to 130% of baseline as measured in the NAc shell by microdialysis during the first hour of sucrose access on day 1, day 2 and day 21. Three control groups failed to show a significant increase in extracellular DA on day 21: Sucrose only for 1 h on days 1 and 21 (Sucrose Twice), ad libitum access to sucrose and chow (Daily Ad libitum Sucrose), and intermittent chow instead of sucrose (Daily Intermittent Chow). Acetylcholine measured at the same time as DA, increased significantly toward the end and after each test meal in all groups. In the Daily Intermittent Sucrose group, the highest ACh levels (133%) occurred during the first sample after the sucrose meal ended. In summary, sucrose-dependent animals have a delayed ACh satiation response, drink more sucrose, and release more DA than sucrose- or binge-experienced, but non-dependent animals. These results suggest another neurochemical similarity between intermittent bingeing on sucrose and drugs of abuse: both can repeatedly increase extracellular DA in the NAc shell.","Daily bingeing on sugar repeatedly releases dopamine in the accumbens shell.","Neuroscience","Rada P and Avena NM and Hoebel BG","",1,2021-03-29 17:45:07,1,2021-03-28 14:08:16,-1,2021-03-29 17:05:08,,,,,,,,

As opposed to 'homeostatic feeding', where food intake is restricted to satisfy one's biological needs, the term 'non-homeostatic' feeding refers to eating for pleasure or the trend to over-consume (palatable) food. Overconsumption is considered a crucial factor in the development of obesity. Exaggerated consumption of (palatable) food, coupled to a loss of control over food intake despite awareness of its negative consequences, suggests that overeating may be a form of addiction. At a molecular level, insulin and leptin resistance are hallmarks of obesity. In this review, we specifically address the question how leptin resistance contributes to enhanced craving for (palatable) food. Since dopamine is a key player in the motivation for food, the interconnection between dopamine, leptin and neuropeptides related to feeding will be discussed. Understanding the mechanisms by which these neuropeptidergic systems hijack the homeostatic feeding mechanisms, thus leading to overeating and obesity is the primary aim of this review. The melanocortin system, one of the crucial neuropeptidergic systems modulating feeding behavior will be extensively discussed. The inter-relationship between neuronal populations in the arcuate nucleus and other areas regulating energy homeostasis (lateral hypothalamus, paraventricular nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamus etc.) and reward circuitry (the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens) will be evaluated and scrutinized.","Neurobiology of overeating and obesity: the role of melanocortins and beyond.","European journal of pharmacology","Pandit R and de Jong JW and Vanderschuren LJ and Adan RA","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:09:43,-1,2021-04-07 19:27:10,,,,,,,,

Differences between the runway situation, employing a discrete-trial procedure and performance measures at three points in the response chain, and the Skinner box situation, used in its free-operant mode with a single performance measure, are discussed in relation to the present findings.","PARTIAL REINFORCEMENT (ACQUISITION) EFFECTS WITHIN SUBJECTS.","Journal of the experimental analysis of behavior","AMSEL A and MACKINNON JR and RASHOTTE ME and SURRIDGE CT","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 02:23:08,-1,2021-04-06 19:25:51,,,,,,,,

In a behavioral economic framework, decreased substitutability of nondrug rewards for drug would explain why drug consumption is behaviorally dominant and relatively resistant to change (eg price-inelastic) in drug-addicted individuals. The goal of the present study was to test this hypothesis using a validated rat model of heroin intake escalation. Escalation was precipitated by long (6 h, long access (LgA)), but not short (1 h, short access (ShA)), daily access to i.v. heroin self-administration. After escalation, the effects of price (ie fixed-ratio value) on heroin consumption were assessed under two alternative reward conditions: in the presence or absence of a nondrug substitute for heroin (ie four freely available chow pellets). As expected, escalated heroin consumption by LgA rats was less sensitive to price than heroin consumption by ShA rats, showing that heroin had acquired greater reinforcing strength during escalation. However, supplying a substitute during access to heroin was sufficient to reverse this post-escalation increase in the reinforcing effectiveness of heroin. Thus, escalated heroin consumption is not associated with a decreased sensitivity to competing nondrug rewards. Escalated drug use may therefore persist, not so much because of a relative devaluation of nondrug substitutes, but because of a loss or reduction of their availability.","Supply of a nondrug substitute reduces escalated heroin consumption.","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Lenoir M and Ahmed SH","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 14:21:59,-1,2021-03-29 17:07:48,,,,,,,,

This relapse is often induced by exposure to cues associated with cocaine use. To account for the persistent propensity for relapse, it has been suggested that cue-induced cocaine craving increases over the first several weeks of abstinence and remains high for extended periods. We and others identified an analogous phenomenon in rats that was termed 'incubation of cocaine craving': time-dependent increases in cue-induced cocaine-seeking over the first months after withdrawal from self-administered cocaine. Cocaine-seeking requires the activation of glutamate projections that excite receptors for alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) in the nucleus accumbens. Here we show that the number of synaptic AMPA receptors in the accumbens is increased after prolonged withdrawal from cocaine self-administration by the addition of new AMPA receptors lacking glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2). Furthermore, we show that these new receptors mediate the incubation of cocaine craving. Our results indicate that GluR2-lacking AMPA receptors could be a new target for drug development for the treatment of cocaine addiction. We propose that after prolonged withdrawal from cocaine, increased numbers of synaptic AMPA receptors combined with the higher conductance of GluR2-lacking AMPA receptors causes increased reactivity of accumbens neurons to cocaine-related cues, leading to an intensification of drug craving and relapse.","Formation of accumbens GluR2-lacking AMPA receptors mediates incubation of cocaine craving.","Nature","Conrad KL and Tseng KY and Uejima JL and Reimers JM and Heng LJ and Shaham Y and Marinelli M and Wolf ME","Drug-related intermittent or continuous access",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:32:15,-1,2021-04-09 15:54:21,,,,,,,,

Drug addiction has been conceptualized as a disorder that involves elements of both impulsivity and compulsivity that yield a composite addiction cycle composed of three stages: 'binge/intoxication', 'withdrawal/negative affect', and 'preoccupation/anticipation' (craving). Animal and human imaging studies have revealed discrete circuits that mediate the three stages of the addiction cycle with key elements of the ventral tegmental area and ventral striatum as a focal point for the binge/intoxication stage, a key role for the extended amygdala in the withdrawal/negative affect stage, and a key role in the preoccupation/anticipation stage for a widely distributed network involving the orbitofrontal cortex-dorsal striatum, prefrontal cortex, basolateral amygdala, hippocampus, and insula involved in craving and the cingulate gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal, and inferior frontal cortices in disrupted inhibitory control. The transition to addiction involves neuroplasticity in all of these structures that may begin with changes in the mesolimbic dopamine system and a cascade of neuroadaptations from the ventral striatum to dorsal striatum and orbitofrontal cortex and eventually dysregulation of the prefrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, and extended amygdala. The delineation of the neurocircuitry of the evolving stages of the addiction syndrome forms a heuristic basis for the search for the molecular, genetic, and neuropharmacological neuroadaptations that are key to vulnerability for developing and maintaining addiction.","Neurocircuitry of addiction.","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Koob GF and Volkow ND","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:13:06,-1,2021-04-07 18:45:01,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To examine the involvement of dopamine in seeking behaviour supported by a natural reinforcer, food, and assess the role of D(2) and D(3) receptor subtypes in food-seeking, using an operant reinstatement procedure. METHODS: Wistar rats were subjected to a within-session extinction procedure. Experimental sessions consisted of a 15-min rewarded period during which each right lever press delivered one food pellet and initiated a 10-s time out period (FR1:TO(10s)), followed by a 45-min extinction period during which responding was no longer rewarded. The reinstating effects of dopaminergic drugs, food priming, or the combination of both treatments, were investigated during spaced test sessions. In dose range studies, dopamine receptor ligands were administered 20 or 30 min into the test sessions. In interaction studies, antagonists were injected immediately before testing. Food priming consisted of two pellets non-contingently delivered 45 min into the test sessions. RESULTS: Well trained rats emitted many responses during the rewarded period but almost none during extinction. During the last 15 min of the test sessions, non-rewarded responding was reinstated by the D(2)/D(3) agonist, apomorphine (0.125-0.25 mg/kg, SC), and the D(3) preferring agonist, 7-OH-DPAT (2-4 mg/kg, SC), but not by quinelorane (0.004-2 mg/kg, SC), another D(3) preferring agonist. In interaction studies, the D(2) preferring antagonist, raclopride (0.06-0.125 mg/kg, IP), and the D(3) preferring antagonist, l-nafadotride (1 mg/kg, IP), counteracted the reinstating effect of apomorphine and 7-OH-DPAT. Pellets non-contingently delivered during extinction, reinstated modest, but significant, responding. Such food-primed food-seeking was altered by neither nafadotride (0.015-1 mg/kg, IP) nor the D(2)/D(3) antagonists, amisulpride (0.25-1 mg/kg, IP) or sulpiride (2-4 mg/kg, IP). Food- and apomorphine-induced response reinstatement were additive, and food-primed food-seeking behaviour was potentiated by 7-OH-DPAT (0.125-1 mg/kg, SC) and quinelorane (7.5-15 micro g/kg, SC). Such a potentiation was reversed by two D(2) antagonists, haloperidol (0.05 mg/kg, IP) and raclopride (0.125 mg/kg, IP), but not by nafadotride (1 mg/kg, IP) and another D(3) preferring antagonist, S 33084 (0.25-2 mg/kg, SC). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that reinstatement of non-reinforced responding by non-contingent food delivery and by dopamine agonists probably depend on different mechanisms. The properties of D(2)/D(3) receptor agonists, to reinstate food seeking at larger doses, and to potentiate food-primed response reinstatement at lower doses, are preferentially mediated by D(2) rather than by D(3) receptors.","Respective roles of dopamine D2 and D3 receptors in food-seeking behaviour in rats.","Psychopharmacology","Duarte C and Biala G and Le Bihan C and Hamon M and Thiebot MH","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:28:23,-1,2021-04-09 15:53:08,,,,,,,,

The present study examined whether female rats on various regimens of sugar access would show behavioral cross-sensitization to a low dose of amphetamine. After a 30-min baseline measure of locomotor activity (day 0), animals were maintained on a cyclic diet of 12-h deprivation followed by 12-h access to 10% sucrose solution and chow pellets (12 h access starting 4 h after onset of the dark period) for 21 days. Locomotor activity was measured again for 30 min at the beginning of days 1 and 21 of sugar access. Beginning on day 22, all rats were maintained on ad libitum chow. Nine days later locomotor activity was measured in response to a single low dose of amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg). The animals that had experienced cyclic sucrose and chow were hyperactive in response to amphetamine compared with four control groups (ad libitum 10% sucrose and chow followed by amphetamine injection, cyclic chow followed by amphetamine injection, ad libitum chow with amphetamine, or cyclic 10% sucrose and chow with a saline injection). These results suggest that a diet comprised of alternating deprivation and access to a sugar solution and chow produces bingeing on sugar that leads to a long lasting state of increased sensitivity to amphetamine, possibly due to a lasting alteration in the dopamine system.","A diet promoting sugar dependency causes behavioral cross-sensitization to a low dose of amphetamine.","Neuroscience","Avena NM and Hoebel BG","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 14:26:38,-1,2021-03-29 17:11:23,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Twenty-six female patients with eating disorders (10 with bulimia nervosa, 16 with anorexia nervosa) and 19 healthy female comparison subjects matched for age and education were presented with food and aversive emotional images while brain activity was recorded with functional magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Women with eating disorders identified the food stimuli as threatening and disgusting. In response to these stimuli, the women with eating disorders had greater activation in the left medial orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices and less activation in the lateral prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, and cerebellum, relative to the comparison group. In addition, women with bulimia nervosa had less activation in the lateral and apical prefrontal cortex, relative to the comparison group. Between-group differences in response to nonspecific emotional stimuli were found in the occipital cortex, parietal cortex, and cerebellum. CONCLUSIONS: A medial prefrontal response to symptom-provoking stimuli was identified as a common feature of anorexia and bulimia nervosa. This finding supports a conceptualization of eating disorders as being transdiagnostic at the neural level. The abnormal prefrontal reaction is associated with symptom-related material, whereas the occipital and cerebellar differences are nonspecific. An abnormal propensity to activate medial prefrontal circuits in response to inappropriate stimuli is common to eating, obsessive-compulsive, and addictive disorders and may account for the compulsive features of behavior in these conditions.","Medial prefrontal cortex activity associated with symptom provocation in eating disorders.","The American journal of psychiatry","Uher R and Murphy T and Brammer MJ and Dalgleish T and Phillips ML and Ng VW and Andrew CM and Williams SC and Campbell IC and Treasure J","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:13:22,-1,2021-04-09 15:29:22,,,,,,,,

Following such a cocaine binge, the user suffers from severe depression mixed with irritability, anxiety, anergia and anhedonia. These symptoms constitute the cocaine withdrawal syndrome. Since cocaine's rewarding effects are mediated by enhanced dopaminergic neurotransmission in the mesocorticolimbic system, it is possible that a long-acting dopamine agonist might block the withdrawal effects associated with the termination of a prolonged bout of cocaine self-administration. An animal model of post-cocaine anhedonia was developed using the elevation in intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) thresholds following the termination of prolonged periods of cocaine self-administration as a measure of an animal's 'anhedonic' state. In the present study, an attempt was made to reverse the postcocaine elevation in ICSS thresholds with acute administration of a dopaminergic agonist, bromocriptine. Rats were allowed to self-administer cocaine for 24 hours continuously. Four hours after the termination of the self-administration session, animals were injected with either vehicle or bromocriptine (1, 2, or 4 mg/kg, IP). Two hours later (6 hours post cocaine), the animals' self-stimulation thresholds were assessed. Confirming previous work, treatment with the vehicle following a cocaine 'binge' resulted in elevated ICSS thresholds compared to predrug baseline levels or to control rats' thresholds. Bromocriptine, at doses that had no effect on ICSS thresholds in control rats, reversed the postcocaine anhedonia in a dose-related manner. These results indicate that bromocriptine-like drugs (pharmacological agents that enhance dopaminergic neurotransmission) may be able to ameliorate some of the effects of cocaine withdrawal on mood and motivational state. In addition, the results of the present study indicate that the proposed animal model of cocaine withdrawal could be useful in the discovery and development of new pharmacotherapies for cocaine withdrawal.","Bromocriptine reverses the elevation in intracranial self-stimulation thresholds observed in a rat model of cocaine withdrawal.","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Markou A and Koob GF","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 02:20:16,-1,2021-04-06 19:23:01,,,,,,,,

Although the effects of cocaine have generally been associated with the ventral striatum, or limbic domain, recent evidence in rodents suggests the involvement of the dorsal striatum (cognitive and sensorimotor domains) in cocaine self-administration. The goals of the present studies were to map the topography of the functional response to cocaine throughout the entire extent of the striatum of monkeys self-administering cocaine and determine whether this response is modified by chronic exposure to cocaine. Rhesus monkeys were trained to self-administer 0.3 mg/kg per injection cocaine for 5 d (initial stages; n = 4) or 100 d (chronic stages; n = 4) and compared with monkeys trained to respond under an identical schedule of food reinforcement (n = 6). Monkeys received 30 reinforcers per session, and metabolic mapping was conducted at the end of the 5th or 100th self-administration session. In the initial phases of cocaine exposure, self-administration significantly decreased functional activity in the ventral striatum, but only in very restricted portions of the dorsal striatum. With chronic cocaine self-administration, however, the effects of cocaine intensified and spread dorsally to include most aspects of both caudate and putamen. Early experiences with cocaine, then, involve mainly the limbic domain, an area that mediates motivational and affective functions. In contrast, as exposure to cocaine continues, the impact of cocaine impinges progressively on the processing of sensorimotor and cognitive information, as well as the affective and motivational information processed in the ventral striatum.","Cocaine self-administration produces a progressive involvement of limbic, association, and sensorimotor striatal domains.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Porrino LJ and Lyons D and Smith HR and Daunais JB and Nader MA","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 14:51:49,-1,2021-04-11 19:27:17,,,,,,,,

By traditional views, the more reliably predictive a Pavlovian CS-UCS association, the more the CS becomes attractive. However, in some cases, less predictability might equal more motivation. Here we examined the effect of introducing uncertainty in CS-UCS association on CS strength as an attractive motivation magnet. In the present study, Experiment 1 assessed the effects of Pavlovian predictability versus uncertainty about reward probability and/or reward magnitude on the acquisition and expression of sign-tracking (ST) and goal-tracking (GT) responses in an autoshaping procedure. Results suggested that uncertainty produced strongest incentive salience expressed as sign-tracking. Experiment 2 examined whether a within-individual temporal shift from certainty to uncertainty conditions could produce a stronger CS motivational magnet when uncertainty began, and found that sign-tracking still increased after the shift. Overall, our results support earlier reports that ST responses become more pronounced in the presence of uncertainty regarding CS-UCS associations, especially when uncertainty combines both probability and magnitude. These results suggest that Pavlovian uncertainty, although diluting predictability, is still able to enhance the incentive motivational power of particular CSs.","Reward uncertainty enhances incentive salience attribution as sign-tracking.","Behavioural brain research","Anselme P and Robinson MJ and Berridge KC","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",1,2021-04-11 19:31:51,-1,2021-04-02 13:06:43,1,2021-04-07 19:05:02,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Using data collected in a 1994 telephone survey of 2,016 randomly chosen Ontario adults, gambling problems are related to the CAGE scale of alcohol problems and the ICD-10 measure of alcohol dependence, as well as smoking, other drug use, and demographic variables. Descriptive tables based on crosstabulations and means are provided, as well as a series of 9 logistic regression models. RESULTS: The most significant predictor of gambling problems was the amount spent on gambling in the preceding 30 days, with alcohol dependence on the ICD-10 scale and age also important predictors. Lottery players, compared to other gamblers, are more likely to be male, relatively less affluent, older on average, more likely to report alcohol problems (but not dependence) and be currently smoking. CONCLUSIONS: The results make clear that heavy drinking and drinking problems are associated with higher levels of spending on gambling and reports of gambling problems. This leads to the suggestion that treatment programs for those with gambling, alcohol or other drug problems should assess that possibility of comorbidity, since the presence of more than one of these problems can significantly affect the success of treatment and contribute to relapse.","Alcohol, drugs and gambling in the Ontario adult population, 1994.","Canadian journal of psychiatry.

Most computational models have focused only on the learning component of reward, but the motivational component is equally important in reward circuitry, and even more directly controls behavior. Modeling the motivational component requires recognition of additional control factors besides learning. Here I discuss how mesocorticolimbic mechanisms generate the motivation component of incentive salience. Incentive salience takes Pavlovian learning and memory as one input and as an equally important input takes neurobiological state factors (e.g. drug states, appetite states, satiety states) that can vary independently of learning. Neurobiological state changes can produce unlearned fluctuations or even reversals in the ability of a previously learned reward cue to trigger motivation. Such fluctuations in cue-triggered motivation can dramatically depart from all previously learned values about the associated reward outcome. Thus, one consequence of the difference between incentive salience and learning can be to decouple cue-triggered motivation of the moment from previously learned values of how good the associated reward has been in the past. Another consequence can be to produce irrationally strong motivation urges that are not justified by any memories of previous reward values (and without distorting associative predictions of future reward value). Such irrationally strong motivation may be especially problematic in addiction. To understand these phenomena, future models of mesocorticolimbic reward function should address the neurobiological state factors that participate to control generation of incentive salience.","From prediction error to incentive salience: mesolimbic computation of reward motivation.","The European journal of neuroscience","Berridge KC","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:56:32,-1,2021-04-11 19:22:01,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: A modification of the model based on the combination of cyclic caloric restrictions and acute stress was developed to further increase its face validity and reliability and, for the first time, to assess its predictive value. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four groups of female rats were employed: group 1 was normally fed and not stressed on the test day (25th); group 2 was fed normally but was exposed to an acute stress on day 25; group 3 was exposed to three cycles (4 days 66% of chow intake + 4 days food ad libitum) of yo-yo dieting but not stressed; and group 4 was exposed to cyclic yo-yo dieting and then stressed. All groups were fed highly palatable food (HPF) for 2 h on days 5-6 and 13-14. Acute stress was elicited by exposing rats to HPF, but preventing them from access to it for 15 min. RESULTS: The combination of cyclic food restriction and stressful exposure to food markedly increased HPF intake. Sibutramine and fluoxetine inhibited food intake in all conditions. Topiramate selectively inhibited compulsive HPF intake in rats submitted to caloric restriction and stress. Midazolam increased HPF intake.

OBJECTIVE: Identify the effects of extended-access to cocaine and 1 or 7 days of deprivation on cocaine-maintained breakpoints on a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement. METHODS: Male, Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to self-administer intravenous cocaine (expt 1: 1.5 mg/kg per infusion; expt 2: 0.75 mg/kg per infusion), and then given various histories of self-administration and deprivation. Breakpoints, the number of infusions self-administered on a PR schedule, were assessed following the deprivation period. RESULTS: Rates of cocaine intake increased when access to cocaine was extended to 6 h/day. From day 1 to day 14, daily intake increased from 92 (+/-2.5) to 101 (+/-2.8) mg/kg in expt 1, and from 55 (+/-4) to 78 (+/-2.2) mg/kg in expt 2.

However, inter-relationships between impulsivity, novelty seeking and anxiety traits are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to investigate the contribution of novelty seeking and anxiety traits to the expression of behavioural impulsivity in rats. METHODS: Rats were screened on the five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) for spontaneously high impulsivity (SHI) and low impulsivity (SLI) and subsequently tested for novelty reactivity and preference, assessed by open-field locomotor activity (OF), novelty place preference (NPP), and novel object recognition (OR). Anxiety was assessed on the elevated plus maze (EPM) both prior to and following the administration of the anxiolytic drug diazepam, and by blood corticosterone levels following forced novelty exposure. Finally, the effects of diazepam on impulsivity and visual attention were assessed in SHI and SLI rats. RESULTS: SHI rats were significantly faster to enter an open arm on the EPM and exhibited preference for novelty in the OR and NPP tests, unlike SLI rats. However, there was no dimensional relationship between impulsivity and either novelty-seeking behaviour, anxiety levels, OF activity or novelty-induced changes in blood corticosterone levels. By contrast, diazepam (0.3-3 mg/kg), whilst not significantly increasing or decreasing impulsivity in SHI and SLI rats, did reduce the contrast in impulsivity between these two groups of animals. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation indicates that behavioural impulsivity in rats on the 5-CSRTT, which predicts vulnerability for cocaine addiction, is distinct from anxiety, novelty reactivity and novelty-induced stress responses, and thus has relevance for the aetiology of drug addiction.","High impulsivity predicting vulnerability to cocaine addiction in rats: some relationship with novelty preference but not novelty reactivity, anxiety or stress.","Psychopharmacology","Molander AC and Mar A and Norbury A and Steventon S and Moreno M and Caprioli D and Theobald DE and Belin D and Everitt BJ and Robbins TW and Dalley JW","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:05:04,-1,2021-04-06 19:28:45,,,,,,,,

Based on the animal punishment literature plus the impression that ethanol diminishes the effects of punishment and impairs decision making, it was predicted that individuals receiving alcohol would increase their risk- taking behavior despite the presence of a negative punishment stimulus (point loss) given on a variable schedule. METHODS: In Experiment 1, a within-subjects design with repeated measures was used where 10 male subjects played a modified computer-generated choice game under three levels of punishment certainty, three levels of punishment severity and four ranges of blood ethanol (0.00%, 0.01-0.049%, 0.050-0.099%, 0.10-0.15%) RESULTS: Results indicated significant decreases in risk taking as either punishment certainty or severity was increased. However, no significant effects were found for ethanol, or interactions of ethanol with punishment certainty or punishment severity. Two additional studies examining aspects of the experimental procedure produced similar results CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results of these studies do not support the hypothesis that high concentrations of blood alcohol are sufficient in and of themselves to eliminate the suppression function of negative punishment contingencies leading to increased risk-taking behavior.

N/OFQ as well as the synthetic NOP receptor agonist Ro 64-6198 have been reported to possess antistress properties and to elicit a pronounced hyperphagic effect in freely feeding rats. These findings have raised our interest to investigate possible interactions in the control of ingestive behavior between N/OFQ and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), which is well known to be a major mediator of stress and to possess anorectic properties. These studies have shown that intracerebroventricular injections of N/OFQ or of Ro 64-6198 reverse the anorectic action evoked by intracerebroventricular administration of CRF. The anti-anorectic effect of N/OFQ or Ro 64-6198 is antagonized by the selective NOP receptor antagonist [Nphe1]N/OFQ1-13NH2, providing evidence that it is mediated by this receptor. The effect occurs at doses that are not hyperphagic per se and is clearly selective versus the anorectic action of CRF since N/OFQ or Ro 64-6198 do not influence the anorectic effect of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Neither N/OFQ nor Ro 64-6198 shows affinity for CRF receptors, suggesting that NOP receptor agonists might act as functional antagonists of CRF with regard to its anorectic action. Microinjection studies have revealed that the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is highly sensitive to the anorectic action of CRF, as well as to the anti-anorectic action of N/OFQ; pretreatment with 0.025-0.25 microg/site of N/OFQ into the BNST blocked the anorectic action of 0.1 microg/site of CRF given in the same area. On the other hand, intra-BNST microinjection of 0.025-0.25 microg/site of N/OFQ did not modify basal food intake. Thus, the BNST may be the site where the functional antagonism between N/OFQ and CRF takes place.

The alternative path LCGM revealed that smoking did not significantly impact delay discounting (p's>.05). Growth mixture modeling identified three smoking trajectories: nonsmokers, early/fast smoking adopters, and slow smoking progressors. Delay discounting was higher in the smoking versus nonsmoking trajectories, but did not discriminate between the smoking trajectories, despite different acquisition patterns. Delay discounting may provide a variable by which to screen for smoking vulnerability and help identify subgroups to target for more intensive smoking prevention efforts that include novel behavioral components directed toward aspects of impulsivity.","Does delay discounting play an etiological role in smoking or is it a consequence of smoking?","Drug and alcohol dependence","Audrain-McGovern J and Rodriguez D and Epstein LH and Cuevas J and Rodgers K and Wileyto EP","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:22:31,-1,2021-04-09 15:50:05,,,,,,,,

Preclinical studies have not explored this clinical problem. Here, we adapted a reinstatement model (commonly used to study relapse to abused drugs) to examine the role of stress and anxiety in relapse to palatable food seeking during dieting. Rats were placed on restricted diet (75-80% of daily standard food) and for 12 intermittent training days (9 h/day, every other day) lever-pressed for palatable food pellets (25% fat, 48% carbohydrate) under a fixed ratio 1 (20-s timeout) reinforcement schedule. Subsequently, the rats were given 10 daily extinction sessions during which lever presses were not reinforced, and were then injected with yohimbine (an alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist that induces stress and anxiety in humans and non-humans) or given a single food pellet to assess reinstatement of food seeking. The rats rapidly learned to lever press for the palatable pellets and across the training days the ratio of timeout nonreinforced lever presses to reinforced lever presses progressively increased more than three-fold, suggesting the development of compulsive eating behavior. After extinction, yohimbine injections and pellet priming reliably reinstated food seeking. The corticotropin-releasing factor1 (CRF1) receptor antagonist antalarmin attenuated the reinstatement induced by yohimbine, but not pellet priming. Antalarmin also reversed yohimbine's anxiogenic effects in the social interaction test. These data suggest that CRF is involved in stress-induced relapse to palatable food seeking, and that CRF1 antagonists should be considered for the treatment of maladaptive eating habits.","The anxiogenic drug yohimbine reinstates palatable food seeking in a rat relapse model: a role of CRF1 receptors.","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Ghitza UE and Gray SM and Epstein DH and Rice KC and Shaham Y","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 14:22:28,-1,2021-03-29 17:26:25,,,,,,,,

However, relatively little is known about the long-term stability of discounting measures typically studied in clinical psychopharmacology. To evaluate the stability of discounting over a 3-month period, the authors compared points of subjective equality (indifference points) with those collected from the same subjects 3 months earlier. Seven delay periods, ranging from 1 week to 25 years, and 7 probability values, ranging from .95 to .05, were assessed in an undergraduate sample (n=22, delay discounting; n=18, probability discounting). The authors examined both differential stability (stability of individual differences) and absolute stability (stability of the group mean) of delay and probability discounting measures as well as their respective indifference points. The results demonstrate that standard delay and probability discounting parameters (e.g., hyperbolic k and area under the curve) had both differential stability and absolute stability across 3 months. Moreover, most indifference points in the delay and probability discounting tasks demonstrated both differential and absolute stability. All together, these results suggest that delay and probability parameters are stable enough to predict future behavior, such as substance abuse.

PYY-treated rats chose to sustain shock to retrieve and consume the preferred food, at a significantly greater speed and quantity. The number of approaches that were met without retrieval of food due to anxiety after PYY treatment indicates that PYY increased motivation towards feeding, rather than anxiolysis.

This study is an initial test of our model. In a 2 x 2 design, we provided ad lib access to calorically dense lard and sucrose (comfort food) + chow or chow alone, and repeatedly restrained half of the rats in each group for 5 d (3 h/d). We measured caloric intake, body weight, caloric efficiency, ACTH, corticosterone (B), and testosterone during the period of restraint and leptin, insulin, and fat depot weights, as well as hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor mRNA at the end of the period. We hypothesized that chronically restrained rats would exhibit a relative increase in comfort food ingestion and that these rats would have reduced HPA responses to repeated restraint. Although total caloric intake was reduced in both groups of restrained rats, compared with controls, the proportion of comfort food ingested increased in the restrained rats compared with their nonrestrained controls. Moreover, caloric efficiency was rescued in the stressed, comfort food group. Furthermore, ACTH and B responses to the repeated restraint bouts were reduced in the rats with access to comfort food. Corticotropin-releasing factor mRNA was reduced in control rats eating comfort food compared with those eating chow, but there were no differences between the stressed groups.

The onset of BED occurs most frequently in adolescent or young adult females and is often associated with a history of dieting and psychological stress. Animal research suggests the importance of two synergistic factors in the aetiology of binge eating: a history of restriction-refeeding cycles (i.e., 'yo-yo' dieting) and exposure to acute stress. In the rat, natural variations in maternal licking and grooming (LG) of pups during the first week of life are associated with long-lasting individual differences in offspring sensitivity to stress. The current set of experiments examined the effects of restriction--refeeding--footshock cycles on intake of highly palatable (HP) food in adolescent and adult female offspring of Low, Mid, and High LG dams. Following cycles of food restriction or unlimited food access, sated rats were exposed to footshock and their intake of HP food and chow was measured at 2, 4, and 22 h post-shock. Adolescent offspring of Low LG mothers displayed shock-induced binge eating, regardless of food-restriction history. In contrast, adolescent female offspring of Mid and High LG mothers failed to exhibit shock-induced increases in food intake. We saw no evidence of binge eating when shock was introduced in adulthood. The data suggest that low levels of maternal care in early life are associated with greater vulnerability to the later development of stress-related binge eating and further that this heightened vulnerability manifests during the adolescent period.","Variations in maternal care influence vulnerability to stress-induced binge eating in female rats.","Physiology & behavior","Hancock SD and Menard JL and Olmstead MC","",-1,2021-03-29 17:45:25,0,2021-03-28 14:25:15,-1,2021-03-29 17:29:48,,,,,,,,

The process of acquiring and consuming drugs can be sufficiently risky and complicated that the casual drug user may choose not to act on every motivation to use drugs. The repetition of drug seeking and taking, however, often results in the gradual development of drug craving and compulsive drug seeking associated with addiction. Moreover, the complex sets of behaviors associated with drug addiction can become ingrained to such an extent that, when activated by drug-associated stimuli or exposure to the drug itself, the processes underlying drug seeking and taking are automatically engaged and very difficult to suppress. Here, we examine the hypothesis that aspects of cocaine seeking and taking become ingrained with repetition, thereby contributing to continued drug use despite a conscious desire to abstain.

The midbrain-striatal dopamine system distinctly codes reward and uncertainty, where dopaminergic activation is a linear function of expected reward and an inverse U-shaped function of uncertainty. In this study, we investigated the dopaminergic coding of reward and uncertainty in 18 pathological gambling sufferers and 16 healthy controls. We used positron emission tomography (PET) with the tracer [(11)C]raclopride to measure dopamine release, and we used performance on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) to determine overall reward and uncertainty. We hypothesized that we would find a linear function between dopamine release and IGT performance, if dopamine release coded reward in pathological gambling. If, on the other hand, dopamine release coded uncertainty, we would find an inversely U-shaped function. The data supported an inverse U-shaped relation between striatal dopamine release and IGT performance if the pathological gambling group, but not in the healthy control group. These results are consistent with the hypothesis of dopaminergic sensitivity toward uncertainty, and suggest that dopaminergic sensitivity to uncertainty is pronounced in pathological gambling, but not among non-gambling healthy controls.

An animal model, involving a measure of initial high-fat diet intake during a few days of access that predicts long-term intake, was designed to classify rats at normal weight that are either high-fat consumers (HFC), which ingest 35% more calories of the high-fat than low-fat chow diet, or controls, which consume similar calories of these two diets. Immediately after their initial access to the diet, the HFC compared to control rats exhibited significantly greater expression of ENK mRNA, in the PVN, nucleus accumbens and central nucleus of the amygdala, but not the arcuate nucleus or basolateral amygdala. This site-specific increase in ENK persisted even when the HFC rats were maintained on a chow diet, suggesting that it reflects an inherent characteristic that can be expressed independently of the diet. It was also accompanied by a greater responsiveness of the HFC rats to the stimulatory effect of a PVN-injected, ENK analogue, D-ala2-met-enkephalinamide, compared to saline on consumption of the high-fat diet.

According to the dominant view in addiction neuroscience and reinforcement modeling, such desires are the simple products of learning, coming from a past association with reward outcome. RESULTS: We demonstrate that cravings are more than merely the products of accumulated pleasure memories-even a repulsive learned cue for unpleasantness can become suddenly desired via the activation of mesocorticolimbic circuitry. Rats learned repulsion toward a Pavlovian cue (a briefly-inserted metal lever) that always predicted an unpleasant Dead Sea saltiness sensation. Yet, upon first reencounter in a novel sodium-depletion state to promote mesocorticolimbic reactivity (reflected by elevated Fos activation in ventral tegmentum, nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, and the orbitofrontal prefrontal cortex), the learned cue was instantly transformed into an attractive and powerful motivational magnet. Rats jumped and gnawed on the suddenly attractive Pavlovian lever cue, despite never having tasted intense saltiness as anything other than disgusting. CONCLUSIONS: Instant desire transformation of a learned cue contradicts views that Pavlovian desires are essentially based on previously learned values (e.g., prediction error or temporal difference models). Instead desire is recomputed at reencounter by integrating Pavlovian information with the current brain/physiological state. This powerful brain transformation reverses strong learned revulsion into avid attraction. When applied to addiction, related mesocorticolimbic transformations (e.g., drugs or neural sensitization) of cues for already-pleasant drug experiences could create even more intense cravings. This cue/state transformation helps define what it means to say that addiction hijacks brain limbic circuits of natural reward.","Instant transformation of learned repulsion into motivational 'wanting'.","Current biology : CB","Robinson MJ and Berridge KC","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:32:08,-1,2021-04-09 15:54:19,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Thirteen female adolescents with binge eating and purging behaviors (i.e., bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa, binge eating/purging type);14 with anorexia nervosa, restricting type; and 13 healthy comparison subjects performed a rapid, jittered event-related go/no-go task. Functional magnetic resonance images were collected using a 3 Tesla GE scanner and a spiral pulse sequence. A whole-brain three-group analysis of variance in SPM5 was used to identify significant activation associated with the main effect of group for the comparison of correct no-go versus go trials. The mean activation in these clusters was extracted for further comparisons in SPSS. RESULTS: The binge eating/purging group showed significantly greater activation than the healthy comparison group in the bilateral precentral gyri, anterior cingulate cortex, and middle and superior temporal gyri as well as greater activation relative to both comparison and restricting type anorexia subjects in the hypothalamus and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Within-group analysis found that only the restricting type anorexia group showed a positive correlation between the percent correct on no-go trials and activation in posterior visual and inferior parietal cortex regions.

A computer-controlled tracking system provided a continuous record of the bird's position by continuously monitoring the location of the bird's head in three-dimensional space. It was found that birds sign-tracked (i.e., approached the conditioned stimulus) when the conditioned stimulus was closest to the site of the unconditioned stimulus, goal-tracked (i.e., approached the site of the unconditioned stimulus in the presence of the conditioned stimulus) when the conditioned stimulus was farthest from the site of the unconditioned stimulus, and engaged in both sign- and goal-tracking (or something intermediate) at intermediate conditioned-stimulus-to-unconditioned-stimulus distances. When both sign- and goal-tracking occurred, the former tended to occur in the first half and the latter in the second half of the interval in which the conditioned stimulus was present. The results suggest (a) whether sign- or goal-tracking (or both) occurs is a function of the distance of the conditioned stimulus from the site of the unconditioned stimulus, (b) the fact that pigeons but not rats have been found to sign-track consistently throughout the duration of the conditioned stimulus may be due to quantitatively rather than qualitatively different effects of conditioned-stimulus-to-unconditioned-stimulus distance across species (i.e., a 'short' conditioned-stimulus-to-unconditioned-stimulus distance for a pigeon may be a 'long' one for a rat), and (c) sign- and goal-tracking may be competing behavioral tendencies that can (e.g., at intermediate conditioned-stimulus-to-unconditioned-stimulus distances) cancel each other out. The findings lend support to theories that specify an interaction between phylogenetic and reinforcement variables in determining whether sign- or goal-tracking will occur in any given experimental preparation.","Sign- versus goal-tracking: effects of conditioned-stimulus-to-unconditioned-stimulus distance.","Journal of the experimental analysis of behavior","Silva FJ and Silva KM and Pear JJ","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:06:04,-1,2021-04-07 18:56:34,,,,,,,,

Protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation of the serine 816 (S816) and S818 residues of GluR1 enhanced 4.1N binding to GluR1 and facilitated GluR1 insertion. In addition, palmitoylation of GluR1 C811 residue modulated PKC phosphorylation and GluR1 insertion. Finally, disrupting 4.1N-dependent GluR1 insertion decreased surface expression of GluR1 and the expression of long-term potentiation.

They also endorsed more frequent attempts at dieting in the past year, and feeling more frequently distressed about their binge eating, at a trend level. There were no group differences in binge eating frequency in the past month, age at onset of binge eating, overvaluation of shape/weight, or likelihood of having used certain weight control behaviors (e.g., vomiting, laxative use) or having sought treatment for an eating disorder in the past. Based on our findings, normal-weight individuals appear to be a behaviorally distinct subset of the BED population with significantly greater usage of both healthy and unhealthy weight control behaviors compared to their obese peers.

The progressive ratio (PR) schedule offers some advantages over FR schedules, although it is now clear that the same implementation cannot be applied across all drug classes. It is likely that the motivation to self-administer psychostimulant vs. opiate drugs is qualitatively different.

There has been little attempt to identify meaningful subgroups defined by their salient biobehavioral differences. In order to address this limitation, we examined genetic and psychological indicators of hedonic eating in obese adults with (n=66) and without (n=70) binge eating disorder (BED). Our analyses focused on dopamine (DA) and opioid genetic markers because of their conjoint association with the functioning of brain reward mechanisms. We targeted three functional polymorphisms related to the D2 receptor (DRD2) gene, as well as the functional A118G polymorphism of the mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1) gene. We found that significantly more obese controls had the 'loss-of-function' A1 allele of Taq1A compared to their BED counterparts, whereas the 'gain-of-function' G allele of A118G occurred with greater frequency in the BED group. A significant gene-gene combination chi2 analysis also indicated that of those participants with the gain-gain genotype (G+ and A1), 80% were in the BED group whereas only 35% with the loss-loss genotype (G- and A1+) were in this group. Finally, BED subjects had significantly higher scores on a self-report measure of hedonic eating. Our findings suggest that BED is a biologically based subtype of obesity and that the proneness to binge eating may be influenced by a hyper-reactivity to the hedonic properties of food--a predisposition that is easily exploited in our current environment with its highly visible and easily accessible surfeit of sweet and fatty foods.","Dopamine for 'wanting' and opioids for 'liking': a comparison of obese adults with and without binge eating.","Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)","Davis CA and Levitan RD and Reid C and Carter JC and Kaplan AS and Patte KA and King N and Curtis C and Kennedy JL","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 14:45:05,-1,2021-04-03 21:38:38,,,,,,,,

In the present paper, we provide a brief overview of eating disorders, the rationale for using AEDs in the treatment of these disorders and review the data supporting the effectiveness of specific AEDs in the treatment of patients with eating disorders. In addition, the potential mechanisms of action of AEDs in these conditions are discussed. Of the available AEDs, topiramate appears to have the broadest spectrum of action as an anti-binge eating, anti-purging and weight loss agent, as demonstrated in two placebo-controlled studies in bulimia nervosa and three placebo-controlled studies in binge-eating disorder (BED) with obesity. Topiramate may also have beneficial effects in night-eating syndrome and sleep-related eating disorder, but controlled trials in these conditions are needed. The results of one small controlled study suggest that zonisamide may have efficacy in BED with obesity. However, both topiramate and zonisamide are associated with adverse effect profiles that may limit their use in patients with eating disorders. Phenytoin may be effective in some patients with compulsive binge eating, particularly if co-morbid EEG abnormalities are present, but available data are too varied to allow definitive conclusions to be made. Carbamazepine and valproate may be effective in treating patients with bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa when they are used to treat an associated psychiatric (e.g. mood) or neurological (e.g. seizure) disorder; otherwise, both agents, particularly valproate, are associated with weight gain.

In well-habituated animals, MSX-3 (5 mg/kg) increased, while raclopride (0.4-0.8 mg/kg) decreased basal locomotor activation; the other drugs were inactive. The locomotor hyperactivation induced by acute cocaine (10 mg/kg) was enhanced by MSX-3 (5-25 mg/kg) or nafadotride (0.4 mg/kg), while CGS 21680 (0.2 mg/kg), SCH 23390 (0.25 mg/kg), raclopride (0.2-0.8 mg/kg) or 7-OH-PIPAT (0.1 mg/kg) decreased this effect of cocaine. Given during the development of sensitization (in combination with 5-daily cocaine, 10 mg/kg, injections), MSX-3 (5-25 mg/kg) increased, but CGS 21680 (0.2 mg/kg) and raclopride (0.8 mg/kg) reduced the locomotor response to a cocaine challenge dose (10 mg/kg) on day 10.

The present results show that adenosine A2ARs and DA D3Rs exert inhibitory actions on acute locomotor responses to cocaine and on the expression of cocaine sensitization, while DA D2Rs had an opposing role in such effects. Pharmacological stimulation of adenosine A2ARs protected against both the development and expression of cocaine sensitization, which may offer a therapeutic potential of A2AR agonists in the treatment of cocaine dependence.

The sensitized rats demonstrated greater motor activity than did the saline-pretreated or nonsensitized animals after AMPA injection into either subnucleus.

Money has the practical advantage of being an objectively quantifiable reinforcer. In this study, we exploit this advantage using a parametric functional magnetic resonance imaging design to look at the patterns of responding to systematically varying reward values. Twelve healthy volunteers were scanned during performance of a rewarded target detection task, in which the reward value varied between task blocks. We observed three distinct patterns of responding in different regions. Amygdala, striatum, and dopaminergic midbrain responded to the presence of rewards, regardless of value. In contrast, premotor cortex showed a linear increase in response with increasing reward value. Finally, medial and lateral foci of orbitofrontal cortex responded nonlinearly, such that response was enhanced for the lowest and highest reward values relative to the midrange. These results suggest functional distinction in response patterns within a distributed reward system.","Differential response patterns in the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex to financial reward in humans: a parametric functional magnetic resonance imaging study.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Elliott R and Newman JL and Longe OA and Deakin JF","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:17:58,-1,2021-04-09 15:44:52,,,,,,,,

Although DeltaFosB and CaMKIIalpha both regulate AMPA glutamate receptor expression and function in NAc, dendritic spine formation on NAc medium spiny neurons (MSNs), and locomotor sensitization to cocaine, no direct link between these molecules has to date been explored. Here, we demonstrate that DeltaFosB is phosphorylated by CaMKIIalpha at the protein-stabilizing Ser27 and that CaMKII is required for the cocaine-mediated accumulation of DeltaFosB in rat NAc. Conversely, we show that DeltaFosB is both necessary and sufficient for cocaine induction of CaMKIIalpha gene expression in vivo, an effect selective for D1-type MSNs in the NAc shell subregion. Furthermore, induction of dendritic spines on NAc MSNs and increased behavioral responsiveness to cocaine after NAc overexpression of DeltaFosB are both CaMKII dependent. Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time induction of DeltaFosB and CaMKII in the NAc of human cocaine addicts, suggesting possible targets for future therapeutic intervention.

The present study tests the persistence of HPA axis dampening and plasticity after cessation of palatable drinking. Adult, male Long-Evans rats (n=10-13) with free access to water and chow were given additional twice-daily access to 4ml sucrose (30%) or water for 14days. Rats were subsequently tested for HPA responsiveness to an acute (20min) restraint stress at 1, 6 and 21days after the cessation of sucrose. Brains were collected for immunohistochemical analysis of FosB/deltaFosB, a marker of long-term neuronal plasticity, in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and nucleus accumbens (NuAc). Prior sucrose consumption significantly decreased the plasma corticosterone response to restraint at 1day after the last palatable drink presentation, and also increased FosB/deltaFosB-positive cells in the BLA and in the NuAc core. This HPA-dampening persisted through 21days after the termination of the palatable drink, as did the increased FosB/deltaFosB immunoreactivity in both the BLA and the NuAc core. These data suggest that chronic palatable food intake causes lasting changes in stress/reward-modulatory circuitry and that the suppressed hormonal response to stress that can persist well beyond periods of palatable drink exposure.","'Snacking' causes long term attenuation of HPA axis stress responses and enhancement of brain FosB/deltaFosB expression in rats.","Physiology & behavior","Christiansen AM and Dekloet AD and Ulrich-Lai YM and Herman JP","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 14:42:14,-1,2021-04-03 21:36:47,,,,,,,,

Given the comorbidity between substance use and gambling disorders, surprisingly little is known about the effects of exposure to reinforcement contingencies experienced during games of chance. As it is a central feature of these games, we characterized the effects of exposure to uncertainty on biochemical and behavioral effects normally observed in rats exposed to amphetamine. Rats in different groups were trained to nose-poke for saccharin under certain [fixed-ratio (FR)] or uncertain conditions [variable-ratio (VR)] for 55 1-h sessions. Ratios were escalated on successive sessions and rats maintained on the last ratio (FR/VR 20) for 20-25 days. Two to three weeks later, rats were tested for their locomotor or nucleus accumbens dopamine (NAcc DA) response to amphetamine or self-administration of the drug using a lever press operant. NAcc DA overflow was also assessed in additional rats during the saccharin sessions. Rats exposed to uncertainty subsequently showed a higher locomotor and NAcc DA response to amphetamine and self-administered more drug infusions relative to rats exposed to predictable reinforcement. NAcc DA levels during the saccharin sessions tracked the variance of the scheduled ratios (a measure of uncertainty). VR rats showed escalating DA overflow with increasing ratios. Exposure to uncertainty triggered neuroadaptations similar to those produced by exposure to abused drugs. As these were produced in drug naive rats both during and after exposure to uncertainty, they provide a novel common pathway to drug and behavioral addictions.","Exposure to conditions of uncertainty promotes the pursuit of amphetamine.","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Mascia P and Neugebauer NM and Brown J and Bubula N and Nesbitt KM and Kennedy RT and Vezina P","",1,2021-04-11 19:33:07,0,2021-03-28 18:18:16,-1,2021-04-06 18:45:33,,,,,,,,

In two experiments exposure to palatable food stimuli led to increases in motivational (hunger) ratings and salivation, and was followed by overeating in restrained subjects compared with the control condition (no food during exposure) and a condition in which nonpreferred food was presented during the exposure phase. The food intake of unrestrained subjects, on the other hand, was reduced following exposure to palatable food in the first experiment. This shows that breakdown of dietary restraint can be induced by food stimuli even when the food does not constitute a preload. Mere exposure to the sight and smell of palatable food is sufficient to precipitate loss of dieting motivation. The effects of exposure on hunger and salivation were, in general, unrelated to food intake or degree of dietary restraint. Therefore, changes in hunger do not appear to directly mediate increased food intake in dieters. Instead, it is tentatively suggested that anxiety resulting from exposure to liked food may play a role both in disinhibiting eating and suppressing salivation in restrained subjects.","Breakdown of dietary restraint following mere exposure to food stimuli: interrelationships between restraint, hunger, salivation, and food intake.","Addictive behaviors","Rogers PJ and Hill AJ","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 18:02:58,-1,2021-04-03 21:51:23,,,,,,,,

In contrast, when sucrose was provided in a modified 60 ml plastic syringe with the same drinking spout, intakes of the Intermittent groups consuming 3.2% and 10% sucrose were greater than those of the respective Daily groups, indicating that binge-type consumption of sucrose occurred.

Today overconsumption of diets rich in sugars contributes together with other factors to drive the current obesity epidemic. Overconsumption of sugar-dense foods or beverages is initially motivated by the pleasure of sweet taste and is often compared to drug addiction. Though there are many biological commonalities between sweetened diets and drugs of abuse, the addictive potential of the former relative to the latter is currently unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we report that when rats were allowed to choose mutually-exclusively between water sweetened with saccharin-an intense calorie-free sweetener-and intravenous cocaine-a highly addictive and harmful substance-the large majority of animals (94%) preferred the sweet taste of saccharin. The preference for saccharin was not attributable to its unnatural ability to induce sweetness without calories because the same preference was also observed with sucrose, a natural sugar. Finally, the preference for saccharin was not surmountable by increasing doses of cocaine and was observed despite either cocaine intoxication, sensitization or intake escalation-the latter being a hallmark of drug addiction. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings clearly demonstrate that intense sweetness can surpass cocaine reward, even in drug-sensitized and -addicted individuals. We speculate that the addictive potential of intense sweetness results from an inborn hypersensitivity to sweet tastants. In most mammals, including rats and humans, sweet receptors evolved in ancestral environments poor in sugars and are thus not adapted to high concentrations of sweet tastants. The supranormal stimulation of these receptors by sugar-rich diets, such as those now widely available in modern societies, would generate a supranormal reward signal in the brain, with the potential to override self-control mechanisms and thus to lead to addiction.","Intense sweetness surpasses cocaine reward.","PloS one","Lenoir M and Serre F and Cantin L and Ahmed SH","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:12:16,-1,2021-04-07 18:40:37,,,,,,,,

This phenomenon, termed behavioral sensitization, is thought to underlie certain aspects of drug addiction. Behavioral sensitization is the consequence of drug-induced neuroadaptive changes in a circuit involving dopaminergic and glutamatergic interconnections between the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex and amygdala. METHODS: The literature was critically reviewed in an effort to discern the relative roles of glutamate and dopamine transmission in the induction and expression of sensitization to amphetamine, cocaine and mu-opioids. In addition, the literature was reviewed to evaluate distinctions between these drugs in the involvement of the relevant brain nuclei listed above. RESULTS: The common substrates between sensitizing drugs are glutamate transmission, especially at the NMDA receptor, and an action in the ventral tegmental area. In contrast, a role for dopamine is only clearly seen in amphetamine sensitization and critical involvement of nuclei outside the ventral tegmental area is found for cocaine and morphine. While enhanced dopamine transmission is associated with sensitization by all three drugs, a role for glutamate is clearly identified only with cocaine sensitization. Accordingly, glutamatergic cortical and allocortical brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex appear more critical for cocaine sensitization. CONCLUSIONS: The distinctions between drugs in the induction and expression of sensitization indicate that behavioral sensitization can arise from multiple neuroadaptations in multiple brain nuclei. This is not only the result of distinct molecular targets for the drugs, but may also include a differential involvement of learned associations. It is postulated that the relatively more robust pharmacological capacity of amphetamine to release dopamine may induce a form of sensitization that is more dependent on adaptations in mesoaccumbens dopamine transmission compared with cocaine and morphine sensitization.","Alterations in dopaminergic and glutamatergic transmission in the induction and expression of behavioral sensitization: a critical review of preclinical studies.","Psychopharmacology","Vanderschuren LJ and Kalivas PW","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 14:52:05,-1,2021-04-11 19:27:31,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of obstetric complications in the development of eating disorders. DESIGN: A blind analysis of the obstetric records of a sample of subjects with anorexia nervosa, with bulimia nervosa, and normal subjects was performed. All of the subjects included in the study belong to the same population birth cohort and were born in the 2 obstetric wards of Padua Hospital, Padua, Italy, between January 17, 1971, and December 30, 1979. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Part of the sample of subjects with eating disorders and all of the controls took part in a prevalence study carried out in 2 randomly selected areas of Padua. In addition, all of the subjects with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa of the same birth cohort who were referred to an outpatient specialist unit were included. The final sample comprised 114 subjects with anorexia nervosa, 73 with bulimia nervosa, and 554 control subjects. RESULTS: Several complications, such as maternal anemia (P = .03), diabetes mellitus (P = .04), preeclampsia (P = .02), placental infarction (P = .001), neonatal cardiac problems (P = .007), and hyporeactivity (P = .03), were significant independent predictors of the development of anorexia nervosa. The risk of developing anorexia nervosa increased with the total number of obstetric complications. In addition, an increasing number of complications significantly anticipated the age at onset of anorexia nervosa (P = .03). The obstetric complications significantly associated with bulimia nervosa were the following: placental infarction (P = .10), neonatal hyporeactivity (P = .005), early eating difficulties (P = .02), and a low birth weight for gestational age (P = .009). Being shorter for gestational age significantly differentiated subjects with bulimia nervosa from both those with anorexia nervosa (P = .04) and control subjects (P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: A significantly higher risk of eating disorders was found for subjects with specific types of obstetric complications.

At the conclusion of the study, body composition and plasma leptin levels were assessed to determine effects of diet and binge/compensate intake on endocrine alterations. As predicted, animals receiving intermittent access to high-fat diet displayed the binge/compensate pattern of feeding and appeared to compensate as a result of the caloric overload accompanying a particular binge episode. In addition, exposure to either shortening or high-fat diet led to alterations in body composition, while only exposure to shortening altered plasma leptin levels. These results suggest that binge-intake behavior occurs on a nutritionally complete high-fat diet and that this regimen is capable of altering both body composition and endocrine profile.","Comparison of hydrogenated vegetable shortening and nutritionally complete high-fat diet on limited access-binge behavior in rats.","Physiology & behavior","Davis JF and Melhorn SJ and Shurdak JD and Heiman JU and Tschop MH and Clegg DJ and Benoit SC","",1,,1,2021-03-26 19:02:07,1,2021-03-29 17:41:27,,,,,,,,

The anticraving effect of acamprosate is thought to be mediated through modifying the balance of GABA and glutamate. Recent studies in animals have suggested that acamprosate may have non-selective effects on craving for both alcohol and food. METHODS: The influence of acamprosate for reducing craving for alcohol and food was assessed in 204 in-patients with alcohol dependence (96 patients treated with acamprosate, PWA; 108 patients were not treated PNA) was assessed at baseline and following 1, 2, and 4 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in craving for alcohol over 4 weeks of treatment in both PWA and PNA groups, but without significant group differences. In contrast, a reduction in food craving was observed only in the PWA group. In addition, there was a significant increase of body mass index (BMI) in the PNA group but not the PWA group over the 4-week period. DISCUSSION: These results demonstrate acamprosate nonselective effects on craving for drinking and eating in alcoholic patients.","The effect of acamprosate on alcohol and food craving in patients with alcohol dependence.","Drug and alcohol dependence","Han DH and Lyool IK and Sung YH and Lee SH and Renshaw PF","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:09:45,-1,2021-04-07 18:39:14,,,,,,,,

There is strong evidence for common pathways that are affected by most addictive drugs. As the other contributors to this volume will indicate, a strong case can also be made for some shared substrates for food and drug rewards in animals. There has been less explicit work on this topic in humans but many lines of evidence support the common mechanism view: Opioid peptides seem to influence food palatability for humans. There is mounting evidence for comorbidity between drug/alcohol abuse and excessive craving or liking for sweets. Anecdotally, elderly individuals tend to 'age-out' of drug abuse, and the elderly also experience markedly fewer food cravings with age. If we focus on the compulsive aspects of food and drug cravings, there is also evidence for overlap: for example, activity in the orbitofrontal cortex is associated with cocaine and alcohol craving. This area is also implicated in the pathology of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Although there is no direct evidence of orbitofrontal involvement in food cravings, there is indirect evidence such as higher than expected co-occurrence of obsessive-compulsive behavior and eating disorders. As a result of bringing together evidence for common substrates for food and for drug rewards, we hope to be able to advance fundamental knowledge of motivational processes and to promote the development of better treatments for drug addiction and for eating disorders.","Of human bondage: food craving, obsession, compulsion, and addiction.","Physiology & behavior","Pelchat ML","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 02:17:59,-1,2021-04-06 19:12:15,,,,,,,,

Experimentally naive adult male rhesus monkeys (n = 22) were divided into a food reinforcement group (n = 6), in which responding was maintained by food presentation, or into four cocaine self-administration groups (n = 4/group), based on dose (0.03 or 0.3 mg/kg per injection) and duration of exposure (5 or approximately 100 sessions). After the last session, monkeys were euthanized, brains were removed, frozen, and coronal sections through the striatum, rostral to the anterior commissure, were processed for D(1) ([3H]SCH23390) and D(2) ([3H]raclopride) receptor autoradiography. Compared with controls, there was no effect of 5 days of cocaine self-administration on D(1) and D(2) receptors. In monkeys with extensive cocaine histories, D(1) receptor densities were significantly increased relative to controls in some parts of the striatum, while D(2) receptor densities were significantly decreased throughout the striatum. These findings demonstrate that chronic cocaine self-administration produces neuroadaptations in dopamine systems, but that these changes do not occur in a parallel fashion.","Effects of cocaine self-administration on striatal dopamine systems in rhesus monkeys: initial and chronic exposure.","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Nader MA and Daunais JB and Moore T and Nader SH and Moore RJ and Smith HR and Friedman DP and Porrino LJ","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 15:09:53,-1,2021-04-11 19:28:06,,,,,,,,

Repeated exposure to this drug systemically or exclusively in the cell body region of these neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) leads to long-lasting changes in dopaminergic function that can be assessed by increased locomotor activity and enhanced DA overflow in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) after re-exposure to the drug. Three experiments were conducted to evaluate the possibility that this enduring sensitized reactivity underlies compulsive drug self-administration. In all experiments, rats were pre-exposed to amphetamine and, starting 10 d later, their intravenous self-administration of the drug was assessed. In the first experiment, rats previously exposed to amphetamine systemically or exclusively in the VTA subsequently worked harder than untreated animals to obtain the drug when the work required to obtain successive infusions was increased progressively. In the second experiment, this progressively increasing workload was found to decrease the magnitude of amphetamine-induced DA overflow observed with successive infusions until responding ceased. Rats previously exposed to amphetamine were more resistant to this decline and more apt to maintain responding. Finally, in experiment three, a noncontingent priming injection of the drug produced a greater NAcc DA response and a greater parallel increase in lever pressing in drug compared with saline pre-exposed rats. Together, these results demonstrate a direct relation between drug-induced sensitization of midbrain dopamine neuron reactivity and the excessive pursuit and self-administration of an abused substance.","Sensitization of midbrain dopamine neuron reactivity promotes the pursuit of amphetamine.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Vezina P and Lorrain DS and Arnold GM and Austin JD and Suto N","Drug-related intermittent or continuous access",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:13:18,-1,2021-04-07 18:45:11,,,,,,,,

Neuroendocrine phenotypes that are able to predispose an individual to the development of drug intake have been identified previously. However, such information has been gathered by comparing individuals who differ in their sensitivity to low doses of the drug. Consequently, it remains unclear whether a phenotype predicting a higher sensitivity to low drug doses would be relevant in environmental conditions, such as the ones encountered by humans in which high drug doses are available. In this report, we studied dose-response, dose-intake, and ratio-intake functions for intravenous cocaine self-administration in the laboratory rat. We show that individual differences in drug self-administration originate from vertical shift in the dose-response function. Thus, no matter the dose, drug intake is very high in some 'vulnerable' subjects and very low in other 'resistant' ones. Vulnerable subjects, the upward shifted ones, would then have a higher chance to develop drug abuse also when high drug doses are available. In conclusion, these results provide a solid foundation for the existence of a drug-vulnerable phenotype relevant for the etiology of addiction.","Vertical shifts in self-administration dose-response functions predict a drug-vulnerable phenotype predisposed to addiction.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Piazza PV and Deroche-Gamonent V and Rouge-Pont F and Le Moal M","Drug-related intermittent or continuous access",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:53:28,-1,2021-04-11 19:09:52,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the subjects' stated preference for either juice or water was not directly correlated with activity in reward regions but instead was correlated with activity in sensorimotor cortex.

Using positron emission tomography, we demonstrated that D2/3 receptor availability is significantly reduced in the nucleus accumbens of impulsive rats that were never exposed to cocaine and that such effects are independent of DA release.

The present study determined whether rats genetically prone to diet-induced obesity (DIO) show preexisting differences in meal microstructure and are sensitive to central anorectic effects of corticotropin-releasing factor type 2 (CRF(2)) receptor stimulation. Male, selectively bred DIO rats and their diet resistant (DR) counterparts (n = 9/genotype) were weaned onto low-fat chow and compared as young adults for spontaneous or intracerebroventricular urocortin 2 administration-induced (0, 0.3, 1, 3 microg) differences in ingestion. DIO rats were hyperphagic selectively at the dark cycle onset, showing shorter latencies to initiate feeding, faster returns to eating following meal completion, and a lower satiety ratio than DR rats. At other times, DIO rats had briefer postmeal intervals, but ate smaller and briefer meals, resulting in normal intake. DIO rats also ate faster than DR rats. Urocortin 2 was less potent in DIO rats, ineffective at the 0.3 microg dose, but produced CRF(2) antagonist-reversible anorexia at higher doses. Though heavier, chow-maintained DIO rats were proportionately as or more lean than DR rats. Thus, DIO rats showed signs of a preexisting, heritable deficit in the maintenance of postmeal satiety and a reduced sensitivity to anorectic CRF(2) agonist stimulation. The meal patterns of DIO rats temporally resemble human 'snacking' behaviour, which predicts adult obesity. Because central CRF(2) stimulation retains full anorectic efficacy at higher doses in the DIO model, manipulating this neuropeptidergic system might yield new therapeutic approaches for diet-induced obesity.","Feeding microstructure in diet-induced obesity susceptible versus resistant rats: central effects of urocortin 2.","The Journal of physiology","Cottone P and Sabino V and Nagy TR and Coscina DV and Zorrilla EP","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 14:24:14,-1,2021-03-29 17:43:45,,,,,,,,

Compared to chow-fed controls, the various fat diets increased total food intake by 4% to 27%. Specifically, rats fed chow and a separate source of fat (fat option diet) consumed more fat and total calories, and gained more weight when the fat source was emulsified corn oil rather than pure corn oil or was vegetable shortening rather than corn oil. However, corn oil and shortening had similar effects on caloric intake and weight gain when presented as emulsified gels. Also, pure and emulsified-gel forms of shortening did not differ in their effects on caloric intake and weight gain. Supplementing the vegetable shortening with micronutrients, however, enhanced its hyperphagia-promoting effect. The results of two-choice tests revealed that the rats' preferences for the orosensory properties of the various fat sources did not account for the differential hyperphagias obtained. Rather, it appears that long-term fat selection and caloric intake are influenced primarily by postingestive factors. Fat selection and total intake were determined not only by the fat source itself, but also by the other diet options.

Although there is now some leveling off, states are still turning to legalized gambling to address financial problems without having to raise taxes. In addition, there is new technology that produces more rapidly addicting games. States are accepting some responsibility and, as of this writing, 12 of them have funded some programs in public education, research, training, and treatment. Although there are only a half dozen inpatient programs and very few qualified counselors and therapists, we can anticipate the development of clinics, residential programs, halfway houses, and alternative sentencing programs. The National Council on Problem Gambling has developed guidelines for the certification of gambling counselors. In addition to the training of mental health professionals, workshops are needed for attorneys, judges, probation and parole officers, and prison administrators. Initially, the task of assessing and diagnosing the pathological gambler was left to a small number of experts. Starting with DSM-IV, there will be clear and reliable criteria available to the professional community. These criteria, which are the product of thorough testing, should easily discriminate the pathological gambler from other types of gamblers. Most of what we have learned about pathological gambling has come in the last 5 years. A major impetus for research has been the Journal of Gambling Studies, which began publication in 1985. A review of the nature and course of the disorder, including the studies of criminal behavior, leads one to conclude that the majority of pathological gamblers (at least 70% to 80%) commit offenses late in the disorder and that these offenses are strictly gambling related. This is a population which is essentially nonviolent and which turns to property crimes out of desperation over gambling losses and their sequelae. The minority (in one study 14%) of gamblers with antisocial personality disorder--the group for whom treatment would be least likely to be effective--can be recognized easily both by the pattern of offenses and by diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality. Once this group is excluded, treatment for the others, in combination with restitution, community service, and some form of monitoring, would seem beneficial both for the individual and for society. Once they have stopped gambling, pathological gamblers are frequently hard-working people, whose mathematical skills and intelligence, high energy, and need to excel make them extremely valuable at their jobs. The alternative, imprisonment, may very well reinforce the disorder.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","The pathological gambler as criminal offender.

To investigate this, acquisition of conditioned responding was examined in pigeon autoshaping under conditions of 100% and 25% reinforcement, holding intertrial interval constant. Contrary to what was predicted, evidence for slowed acquisition in partially reinforced animals was observed with several response measures. However, asymptotic performance was superior with 25% reinforcement. A switching of reinforcement contingencies after initial acquisition did not immediately affect responding. After further sessions, partial reinforcement augmented responding, whereas continuous reinforcement did not, irrespective of an animal's reinforcement history. Subsequent training with a novel stimulus maintained the response patterns.

Extensive attention has been paid to both methods in computational analyses of instrumental learning. By contrast, although a full computational analysis has been lacking, Pavlovian learning and prediction has typically been presumed to be solely model-free. Here, we revise that presumption and review compelling evidence from Pavlovian revaluation experiments showing that Pavlovian predictions can involve their own form of model-based evaluation. In model-based Pavlovian evaluation, prevailing states of the body and brain influence value computations, and thereby produce powerful incentive motivations that can sometimes be quite new.

When reward is delivered probabilistically, DA neurons reflect this uncertainty by increasing their firing rates in a period between the sensory cue and reward delivery time. Probability of reward, however, has been externally conveyed by visual cues, and it is not known whether DA neurons would signal uncertainty arising internally. Here we show that DA neurons code the uncertainty associated with a perceptual judgment about the presence or absence of a vibrotactile stimulus. We observed that uncertainty modulates the activity elicited by a go cue instructing monkey subjects to communicate their decisions. That is, the same go cue generates different DA responses depending on the uncertainty level of a judgment made a few seconds before the go instruction. Easily detected suprathreshold stimuli elicit small DA responses, indicating that future reward will not be a surprising event. In contrast, the absence of a sensory stimulus generates large DA responses associated with uncertainty: was the stimulus truly absent, or did a low-amplitude vibration go undetected? In addition, the responses of DA neurons to the stimulus itself increase with vibration amplitude, but only when monkeys correctly detect its presence. This finding suggests that DA activity is not related to actual intensity but rather to perceived intensity. Therefore, in addition to their well-known role in reward prediction, DA neurons code subjective sensory experience and uncertainty arising internally from perceptual decisions.","Dopamine neurons code subjective sensory experience and uncertainty of perceptual decisions.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","de Lafuente V and Romo R","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 14:51:59,-1,2021-04-11 19:27:27,,,,,,,,

Experimental animals displayed a precipitous drop in body temperature and behavioral changes associated with withdrawal during week 3, when sugar was removed. There was an increase in kilocalories (kcal) consumed during weeks 2 and 4 by experimental animals and, by the end of the experiment, these animals showed a greater percent increase in body weight. Elevated blood glucose levels were found in experimental animals. The study demonstrates that the effects of sugar addiction, withdrawal and relapse are similar to those of drugs of abuse.

Additionally, in learning tasks where conditioned cues probabilistically predict rewards, dopamine neurons show sustained cue-evoked responses that are correlated with the variance of reward and are maximal to cues predicting rewards with a probability of 0.5. Therefore, it has been suggested that sustained dopamine activity after cue presentation encodes the uncertainty of impending reward delivery. In the current study we examined the acquisition and maintenance of these neural correlates using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in rats implanted with carbon fiber electrodes in the nucleus accumbens core during probabilistic Pavlovian conditioning. The advantage of this technique is that we can sample from the same animal and recording location throughout learning with single trial resolution. We report that dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core contains correlates of both expected value and variance. A quantitative analysis of these signals throughout learning, and during the ongoing updating process after learning in probabilistic conditions, demonstrates that these correlates are dynamically encoded during these phases. Peak CS-evoked responses are correlated with expected value and predominate during early learning while a variance-correlated sustained CS signal develops during the post-asymptotic updating phase.","Dynamic shaping of dopamine signals during probabilistic Pavlovian conditioning.","Neurobiology of learning and memory","Hart AS and Clark JJ and Phillips PEM","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:13:00,-1,2021-04-07 18:44:42,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Water O 15 positron emission tomography (PET) studies were used to localize alterations in synaptic activity related to cue-induced drug craving in 8 crack cocaine-dependent African American men. In a novel approach, script-guided imagery of autobiographical memories were used as individualized cues to internally generate a cocaine craving state and 2 control (ie, anger and neutral episodic memory recall) states during PET image acquisition. RESULTS: The mental imagery of personalized drug use and anger-related scripts was associated with self-ratings of robust drug craving or anger, and comparable alterations in heart rate. Compared with the neutral imagery control condition, imagery-induced drug craving was associated with bilateral (right hemisphere amygdala activation greater than left) activation of the amygdala, the left insula and anterior cingulate gyrus, and the right subcallosal gyrus and nucleus accumbens area. Compared with the anger control condition, internally generated drug craving was associated with bilateral activation of the insula and subcallosal cortex, left hippocampus, and anterior cingulate cortex and brainstem. A brain-wide pixel-by-pixel search indicated significant positive and negative correlations between imagery-induced cocaine craving and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in distributed sites. CONCLUSIONS: The collected findings suggest the craving-related activation of a network of limbic, paralimbic, and striatal brain regions, including structures involved in stimulus-reward association (amygdala), incentive motivation (subcallosal gyrus/nucleus accumbens), and anticipation (anterior cingulate cortex).","Neural activity related to drug craving in cocaine addiction.","Archives of general psychiatry","Kilts CD and Schweitzer JB and Quinn CK and Gross RE and Faber TL and Muhammad F and Ely TD and Hoffman JM and Drexler KP","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 15:10:52,-1,2021-04-11 19:28:21,,,,,,,,

It stated that the public's health was the industry's concern above all others and promised a variety of good-faith changes. What followed were decades of deceit and actions that cost millions of lives. In the hope that the food history will be written differently, this article both highlights important lessons that can be learned from the tobacco experience and recommends actions for the food industry. METHODS: A review and analysis of empirical and historical evidence pertaining to tobacco and food industry practices, messages, and strategies to influence public opinion, legislation and regulation, litigation, and the conduct of science. FINDINGS: The tobacco industry had a playbook, a script, that emphasized personal responsibility, paying scientists who delivered research that instilled doubt, criticizing the 'junk' science that found harms associated with smoking, making self-regulatory pledges, lobbying with massive resources to stifle government action, introducing 'safer' products, and simultaneously manipulating and denying both the addictive nature of their products and their marketing to children. The script of the food industry is both similar to and different from the tobacco industry script. CONCLUSIONS: Food is obviously different from tobacco, and the food industry differs from tobacco companies in important ways, but there also are significant similarities in the actions that these industries have taken in response to concern that their products cause harm. Because obesity is now a major global problem, the world cannot afford a repeat of the tobacco history, in which industry talks about the moral high ground but does not occupy it.","The perils of ignoring history: Big Tobacco played dirty and millions died.

The neurobiology of BED is poorly understood. Brain dopamine, which regulates motivation for food intake, is likely to be involved. We assessed the involvement of brain dopamine in the motivation for food consumption in binge eaters. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans with [(11)C]raclopride were done in 10 obese BED and 8 obese subjects without BED. Changes in extracellular dopamine in the striatum in response to food stimulation in food-deprived subjects were evaluated after placebo and after oral methylphenidate (MPH), a drug that blocks the dopamine reuptake transporter and thus amplifies dopamine signals. Neither the neutral stimuli (with or without MPH) nor the food stimuli when given with placebo increased extracellular dopamine. The food stimuli when given with MPH significantly increased dopamine in the caudate and putamen in the binge eaters but not in the nonbinge eaters. Dopamine increases in the caudate were significantly correlated with the binge eating scores but not with BMI. These results identify dopamine neurotransmission in the caudate as being of relevance to the neurobiology of BED. The lack of correlation between BMI and dopamine changes suggests that dopamine release per se does not predict BMI within a group of obese individuals but that it predicts binge eating.","Enhanced striatal dopamine release during food stimulation in binge eating disorder.","Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)","Wang GJ and Geliebter A and Volkow ND and Telang FW and Logan J and Jayne MC and Galanti K and Selig PA and Han H and Zhu W and Wong CT and Fowler JS","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 02:13:32,-1,2021-04-06 19:07:32,,,,,,,,

'Liking' mechanisms include hedonic circuits that connect together cubic-millimeter hotspots in forebrain limbic structures such as nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum (where opioid/endocannabinoid/orexin signals can amplify sensory pleasure). 'Wanting' mechanisms include larger opioid networks in nucleus accumbens, striatum, and amygdala that extend beyond the hedonic hotspots, as well as mesolimbic dopamine systems, and corticolimbic glutamate signals that interact with those systems.

As described for most of GPCRs, opioid receptor desensitization involves their phosphorylation by kinases and their uncoupling from G-proteins realized by arrestins. More recently, opioid receptor trafficking was shown to contribute to desensitization. In this review, our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of desensitization and recent progress on the role of opioid receptor internalization, recycling or degradation in desensitization will be reported.

In the first three regions, the signal increases were attenuated in an age-dependent manner, whereas, in the right prefrontal area, the converse was seen.

In Pavlovian autoshaping, repeated exposure to uncertainty of reward prediction can enhance motivated sign-tracking or attraction to a discrete reward-predicting cue (lever-conditioned stimulus; CS+), as well as produce cross-sensitization to amphetamine. However, it remains unknown how amphetamine sensitization or repeated restraint stress interact with uncertainty in controlling CS+ incentive salience attribution reflected in sign-tracking. Here rats were tested in 3 successive phases. First, different groups underwent either induction of amphetamine sensitization or repeated restraint stress, or else were not sensitized or stressed as control groups (either saline injections only, or no stress or injection at all). All next received Pavlovian autoshaping training under either certainty conditions (100% CS-UCS association) or uncertainty conditions (50% CS-UCS association and uncertain reward magnitude). During training, rats were assessed for sign-tracking to the CS+ lever versus goal-tracking to the sucrose dish. Finally, all groups were tested for psychomotor sensitization of locomotion revealed by an amphetamine challenge. Our results confirm that reward uncertainty enhanced sign-tracking attraction toward the predictive CS+ lever, at the expense of goal-tracking. We also reported that amphetamine sensitization promoted sign-tracking even in rats trained under CS-UCS certainty conditions, raising them to sign-tracking levels equivalent to the uncertainty group. Combining amphetamine sensitization and uncertainty conditions did not add together to elevate sign-tracking further above the relatively high levels induced by either manipulation alone.

In contrast, chronic exposure to cocaine does not induce these proteins, but instead causes the persistent expression of highly stable isoforms of deltaFosB. deltaFosB is also induced in the nucleus accumbens by repeated exposure to other drugs of abuse, including amphetamine, morphine, nicotine and phencyclidine. The sustained accumulation of deltaFosB in the nucleus accumbens indicates that this transcription factor may mediate some of the persistent neural and behavioural plasticity that accompanies chronic drug exposure. Using transgenic mice in which deltaFosB can be induced in adults in the subset of nucleus accumbens neurons in which cocaine induces the protein, we show that deltaFosB expression increases the responsiveness of an animal to the rewarding and locomotor-activating effects of cocaine. These effects of deltaFosB appear to be mediated partly by induction of the AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole) glutamate receptor subunit GluR2 in the nucleus accumbens.

Neonatal maternal separation is considered as an animal model of stressful experience early in life. Many of studies have demonstrated its impact both on the activity of HPA axis and the development of psycho-emotional disorders later in life. In this paper, a series of our researches on developing an animal model of eating disorders is reviewed. An animal model of neonatal maternal separation was used; Sprague-Dawley pups were separated from dam daily for 180 min during the first 2 weeks of life (MS) or undisturbed. Anxiety-/depression-like behaviors were observed in MS rats at the age of two months with decreased serotonergic activity in the hippocampus and the raphe. Post-weaning social isolation promoted food intake and weight gain of adolescent MS pups, with impacts on anxiety-like behaviors. Sustained hyperphagia was observed in the MS pups subjected to a fasting/refeeding cycle repeatedly during adolescence, with increased plasma corticosterone levels. Anhedonia, major symptom of depression, to palatable food was observed in adolescent MS pups with blunted response of the mesolimbic dopaminergic activity to stress. Results suggest that neonatal maternal separation lead to the development of eating disorders when it is challenged with social or metabolic stressors later in life, in which dysfunctions in the HPA axis and the brain monoaminergic systems may play important roles.","An animal model of eating disorders associated with stressful experience in early life.","Hormones and behavior","Jahng JW","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:15:24,-1,2021-04-07 18:46:19,,,,,,,,

Subsequent analyses indicated that after the seventh cocaine injection, there was a significant increase in activity of the sucrose group early in the session (compared to the chow group). When tested 14 days later, there was a prolongation of the effect of cocaine in the sucrose group.

Glutamate systems are known to participate in the induction and expression of sensitization by psychostimulants. Group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), because they negatively regulate both vesicular and nonvesicular glutamate release, are thus well positioned to gate its expression. Here we report that the expression of locomotor sensitization by AMPH is completely prevented by a systemic injection of the selective group II mGluR agonist LY379268 at a dose that produced no effects when administered alone. The activation of group II mGluRs in AMPH-sensitized rats also reduced the enhanced overflow of both dopamine and glutamate normally observed in the nucleus accumbens, a brain region critical for the generation of locomotor and drug self-administration behaviours. To directly determine the effect of group II mGluR activation on enhanced drug self-administration, AMPH-sensitized rats were allowed to self-administer a mixture of LY379268 and AMPH. These rats continued to self-administer but did not exhibit the enhanced work output and drug intake observed in AMPH-sensitized rats self-administering AMPH alone. Thus, activating group II mGluRs prevents the expression of different manifestations of AMPH sensitization including enhanced self-administration of the drug. These receptors may represent a potentially important target for therapeutic intervention directed at drugs of abuse.","Activation of group II mGlu receptors blocks the enhanced drug taking induced by previous exposure to amphetamine.","The European journal of neuroscience","Kim JH and Austin JD and Tanabe L and Creekmore E and Vezina P","Drug-related intermittent or continuous access",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:26:08,-1,2021-04-09 15:52:00,,,,,,,,

This study investigated whether cocaine administered in a paradigm that mimics the human pattern of cocaine abuse produces behavioral sensitization and if there are concomitant changes in dopamine receptor levels. The time course of alterations in cocaine-induced locomotor activity and dopamine receptor densities was determined. Male Fischer rats were injected with saline or cocaine (15 mg/kg) three times daily at 1-hr intervals at the beginning of the light cycle to approximate the manner in which cocaine is often abused by humans both in terms of temporal pattern and in relation to circadian rhythm. Cocaine administered in this binge-like regimen produced an increase in locomotor activity during each hour postinjection. The increase in activity was significantly greater on the 13th day of drug administration than on the first day indicating sensitization to the locomotor-activating effects of cocaine. D1 and D2 dopamine receptors were measured after 2, 7 and 14 days of saline or cocaine injections using quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography. Up-regulation of D1 receptors occurred in the olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum and substantia nigra after 14 days of cocaine treatment. Transient increases in D2 receptor number were found in the olfactory tubercle, rostral nucleus accumbens and rostral caudate putamen after 7 days of cocaine injections which returned to baseline levels after 14 days of cocaine treatment. The temporal pattern of receptor up-regulation suggests that D1 receptors are involved in the development of behavioral sensitization to cocaine.","Time course of the development of behavioral sensitization and dopamine receptor up-regulation during binge cocaine administration.","The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics","Unterwald EM and Ho A and Rubenfeld JM and Kreek MJ","Drug-related intermittent or continuous access",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:49:12,-1,2021-04-11 19:06:45,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we review the current literature on a class of drugs that act as modulating glutamate system in PG. A total of 19 studies have been included, according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Clinical trial and case series using glutamatergic drugs (N-acetylcysteine, memantine, amantadine, topiramate, acamprosate, baclofen, gabapentin, pregabalin, and modafinil) will be presented to elucidate the effectiveness on gambling behaviors and on the related clinical dimensions (craving, withdrawal, and cognitive symptoms) in PG patients. The results have been discussed to gain more insight in the pathophysiology and treatment of PG. In conclusion, manipulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission appears to be promising in developing improved therapeutic agents for the treatment of gambling disorders. Further studies are required.

Although animals are purported to engage in optimal foraging behavior, similar sub-optimal behavior can be found in pigeons. They show a preference for an alternative that is associated with a low probability of reinforcement (e.g., one that is followed by a red hue on 20% of the trials and then reinforcement or by a green hue on 80% of the trials and then the absence of reinforcement) over an alternative that is associated with a higher probability of reinforcement (e.g., blue or yellow each of which is followed by reinforcement 50% of the time). This effect appears to result from the strong conditioned reinforcement associated with the stimulus that is always followed by reinforcement. Surprisingly, although it is experienced four times as much, the stimulus that is never followed by reinforcement does not appear to result in significant conditioned inhibition (perhaps due to the absence of observing behavior). Similarly, human gamblers tend to overvalue wins and undervalue losses.

In conventional theories, a governing faculty like the ego evaluates future choices consistently over time, discounting their value for delay exponentially, that is, by a constant rate; impulses arise when this ego is confronted by a conditioned appetite. Breakdown of Will (Ainslie 2001) presents evidence that contradicts this model. Both people and nonhuman animals spontaneously discount the value of expected events in a curve where value is divided approximately by expected delay, a hyperbolic form that is more bowed than the rational, exponential curve. With hyperbolic discounting, options that pay off quickly will be temporarily preferred to richer but slower-paying alternatives, a phenomenon that, over periods from minutes to days, can account for impulsive behaviors, and over periods of fractional seconds can account for involuntary behaviors. Contradictory reward-getting processes can in effect bargain with each other, and stable preferences can be established by the perception of recurrent choices as test cases (precedents) in recurrent intertemporal prisoner's dilemmas. The resulting motivational pattern resembles traditional descriptions of the will, as well as of compulsive phenomena that can now be seen as side-effects of will: over-concern with precedent, intractable but circumscribed failures of self-control, a motivated ('dynamic') unconscious, and an inability to exploit emotional rewards. Hyperbolic curves also suggest a means of reducing classical conditioning to motivated choice, the last necessary step for modeling many involuntary processes like emotion and appetite as reward-seeking behaviors; such modeling, in turn, provides a rationale for empathic reward and the 'construction' of reality.","Precis of Breakdown of Will.","The Behavioral and brain sciences","Ainslie G","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:19:58,-1,2021-04-09 15:48:05,,,,,,,,

Previous research focused almost entirely on psychosocial risk factors during puberty to the relative exclusion of biological influences. The current study addressed this gap by examining the emergence of binge eating during puberty in a rat model. We predicted that there would be minimal differences in binge eating proneness during pre-early puberty, but significant differences would emerge during puberty. Two independent samples of female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 30 and n = 36) were followed longitudinally across pre-early puberty, mid-late puberty, and adulthood. Binge eating proneness was defined using the binge eating resistant (BER)/binge eating prone (BEP) model of binge eating that identifies BER and BEP rats in adulthood. Across two samples of rats, binge eating proneness emerged during puberty. Mixed linear models showed little difference in palatable food intake between BER and BEP rats during pre-early puberty, but significant group differences emerged during mid-late puberty and adulthood. Group differences could not be accounted for by changes in nonpalatable food intake or body weight. Similar to patterns in humans, individual differences in binge eating emerge during puberty in female rats.

The article reviews the recent systematic research on the distinguishing baseline characteristics including demographic characteristics and the influence of family history, and clinical features such as depressive symptomatology and suicidal ideation, and the outcome of treatment for depression in patients with comorbid major depressive disorder and substance use disorders. The review also addresses the possible explanations cited in the literature as to why these two disorders tend to co-occur and the implications of the comorbidity of these illnesses on treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Nearly one-third of patients with major depressive disorder also have substance use disorders, and the comorbidity yields higher risk of suicide and greater social and personal impairment as well as other psychiatric conditions. Although the treatment of comorbid major depressive disorder and substance use disorders with medication is likely effective, the differential treatment effects based on substance use disorder comorbidity have been understudied. SUMMARY: Emerging results of recent studies comparing the outcome of major depressive disorder patients with comorbid major depressive disorder and substance use disorders suggest that there are fewer differential effects based on comorbidity than previously anticipated by older assumptions from smaller, less methodologically rigorous studies.","Major depression and comorbid substance use disorders.","Current opinion in psychiatry","Davis L and Uezato A and Newell JM and Frazier E","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:05:57,-1,2021-04-07 18:07:13,,,,,,,,

Inter-temporal choice behaviour (choice between reinforcers differing in size and delay) has been proposed as a model of 'impulsive choice' in animals. We recently found that destruction of the OPFC disrupted inter-temporal choice in rats. It is not known whether the dopaminergic projection to the OPFC contributes to the regulation of inter-temporal choice. OBJECTIVE: A quantitative method was used to compare inter-temporal choice in rats whose OPFC had been depleted of dopamine with that of sham-lesioned control rats. METHODS: Under halothane anaesthesia, rats received injections of 6-hydroxydopamine into the OPFC (2 microg microl(-1), 0.5 microl, two injections in each hemisphere), or sham lesions (injections of the vehicle). They were trained to press two levers (A and B) for sucrose reinforcement (0.6 M) in discrete-trials schedules. In free-choice trials, a press on A resulted in delivery of 50 microl of the sucrose solution after a delay dA; a press on B resulted in delivery of 100 microl of the same solution after a delay dB. dB was increased progressively across successive blocks of six trials in each session, while dA was manipulated systematically across phases of the experiment. The indifference delay, dB(50) (value of dB corresponding to 50% choice of B) was estimated for each rat in each phase. Linear functions of dB(50) versus dA were derived, and the parameters of the function compared between the groups. Concentrations of monoamines in the OPFC were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography at the end of the experiment. RESULTS: In both groups, dB(50) increased linearly with dA (r2>0.9 in each case). The slope of the function was significantly steeper in the lesioned group than the sham-lesioned group, whereas the intercept did not differ significantly between the groups. When delays of 4 or 8 s were imposed on the smaller reinforcer, the lesioned rats showed greater tolerance of delay to the larger reinforcer (i.e. they exhibited longer values of dB(50)) than the sham-lesioned rats. Dopamine, noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine levels in the OPFC of the lesioned group were 20, 75 and 98% of those of the sham-lesioned group. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that dopaminergic afferents to the OPFC contribute to the regulation of inter-temporal choice behaviour due to their role in determining organisms' sensitivity both to reinforcer size and to delay of reinforcement.","Effects of orbital prefrontal cortex dopamine depletion on inter-temporal choice: a quantitative analysis.","Psychopharmacology","Kheramin S and Body S and Ho MY and Velazquez-Martinez DN and Bradshaw CM and Szabadi E and Deakin JF and Anderson IM","",-1,2021-04-11 19:33:22,0,2021-03-29 02:24:46,-1,2021-04-06 19:27:06,,,,,,,,

Only pathological gamblers revealed a significant positive correlation with a family history of gambling and reached positive scores (>1.5) for some likely psychiatric symptoms.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of adolescents with face-to-face interviews using a modified version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. SETTING: Combined household and school adolescent samples. PARTICIPANTS: Nationally representative sample of 10,123 adolescents aged 13 to 18 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence and correlates of eating disorders and subthreshold conditions. RESULTS: Lifetime prevalence estimates of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder were 0.3%, 0.9%, and 1.6%, respectively. Important differences were observed between eating disorder subtypes concerning sociodemographic correlates, psychiatric comorbidity, role impairment, and suicidality. Although the majority of adolescents with an eating disorder sought some form of treatment, only a minority received treatment specifically for their eating or weight problems. Analyses of 2 related subthreshold conditions suggest that these conditions are often clinically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Eating disorders and subthreshold eating conditions are prevalent in the general adolescent population. Their impact is demonstrated by generally strong associations with other psychiatric disorders, role impairment, and suicidality.

We determined if rats identified as binge-eating prone (BEP) similarly display abnormal motivation for palatable food. METHOD: Food-sated BEP and binge-eating resistant (BER) rats were given voluntary access to palatable food paired with increasing intensity of footshock. Later, they were exposed to a period of cyclic caloric restriction-refeeding. RESULTS: BEPs consumed significantly more and tolerated higher levels of footshock for palatable food than BERs. Cyclic restriction-refeeding increased BERs' tolerance of shock for palatable food. DISCUSSION: Previously observed parallels of the rat BEP model to human binge eating can now be extended to include an abnormal motivation for palatable food. This model should prove useful in identifying specific genes that interact with the nutritional environment to mediate binge eating and may point to novel physiological targets to treat compulsive overeating.","Motivation for palatable food despite consequences in an animal model of binge eating.","The International journal of eating disorders","Oswald KD and Murdaugh DL and King VL and Boggiano MM","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 14:10:15,-1,2021-03-29 18:38:53,,,,,,,,

The goal of this paper is to review current, non-serotonergic pharmaceutical approaches to treat binge eating. Further, using information derived from preclinical models, we discuss candidate neurotransmitter systems for study as targets for the treatment of binge eating. Dopaminergic circuits have been implicated in both laboratory animal models and human studies of binge eating, though existing medications specifically targeting the dopaminergic system have been found to have adverse side effects. Opioidergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) systems also appear to be highly involved in aspects of binge eating; further, opioid antagonists, such as naloxone and naltrexone, and GABA agonists, such as baclofen, have all been shown to be effective in treating alcohol dependence and may be equally efficacious in attenuating binge eating. Preclinical evidence, and some clinical evidence, suggests that cannabinoid antagonism may also be useful in the treatment of binge eating, although the specific effect of antagonists, on binge consumption remains unclear. Overall, each of these neurotransmitter systems provides a promising avenue for new pharmacotherapy development for binge eating, and preclinical and human studies provide a strong rationale for the development of highly-selective drugs that target this neurocircuitry.","Pharmacological interventions for binge eating: lessons from animal models, current treatments, and future directions.","Current pharmaceutical design","Berner LA and Bocarsly ME and Hoebel BG and Avena NM","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 14:47:52,-1,2021-04-03 21:46:51,,,,,,,,

Similar changes in reward homeostasis induced by cocaine or heroin are considered to be crucial in triggering the transition from casual to compulsive drug-taking. Accordingly, we detected compulsive-like feeding behavior in obese but not lean rats, measured as palatable food consumption that was resistant to disruption by an aversive conditioned stimulus. Striatal dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs) were downregulated in obese rats, as has been reported in humans addicted to drugs. Moreover, lentivirus-mediated knockdown of striatal D2Rs rapidly accelerated the development of addiction-like reward deficits and the onset of compulsive-like food seeking in rats with extended access to palatable high-fat food. These data demonstrate that overconsumption of palatable food triggers addiction-like neuroadaptive responses in brain reward circuits and drives the development of compulsive eating.

These conditions mimic dieting, stress, and 'junk' food indulgence, respectively, all common etiological and maintenance factors in human binge eating. Four groups of rats are used: one subjected to cyclic food restriction, another to acute footshock stress, another to both of these (R + S), and a control. Neither cyclic restriction nor stress alone produces binge eating, but the R + S rats, despite satiety, double their intake of palatable food in a discrete period of time (i.e., binge) when stressed. This protocol recapitulates critical properties of human binge eating, namely preference for palatable food, dieting- and stress-induced vulnerability to binging, and eating for reward versus metabolic need.

It is theorized that increased impulsivity at least partly underlies the inability to control eating behaviour; being more impulsive is supposed to make it more difficult to resist food intake. Thirty-three obese children in a residential setting and 31 lean control children are tested. Impulsivity is measured with two behavioural measures (inhibitory control and sensitivity to reward) and questionnaires. Results show that the obese children in treatment were more sensitive to reward and showed less inhibitory control than normal weight children. In addition, the obese children with eating binges were more impulsive than the obese children without eating binges. Most interesting finding was that the children that were the least effective in inhibiting responses, lost less weight in the residential treatment program. To conclude: impulsivity is a personality characteristic that potentially has crucial consequences for the development and maintenance, as well as treatment of obesity.","Why obese children cannot resist food: the role of impulsivity.","Eating behaviors","Nederkoorn C and Braet C and Van Eijs Y and Tanghe A and Jansen A","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:04:20,-1,2021-04-06 19:28:38,,,,,,,,

Here, we integrate findings from positron emission tomography imaging studies on DA's role in drug abuse/addiction and in obesity and propose a common model for these two conditions. Both in abuse/addiction and in obesity, there is an enhanced value of one type of reinforcer (drugs and food, respectively) at the expense of other reinforcers, which is a consequence of conditioned learning and resetting of reward thresholds secondary to repeated stimulation by drugs (abuse/addiction) and by large quantities of palatable food (obesity) in vulnerable individuals (i.e. genetic factors). In this model, during exposure to the reinforcer or to conditioned cues, the expected reward (processed by memory circuits) overactivates the reward and motivation circuits while inhibiting the cognitive control circuit, resulting in an inability to inhibit the drive to consume the drug or food despite attempts to do so. These neuronal circuits, which are modulated by DA, interact with one another so that disruption in one circuit can be buffered by another, which highlights the need of multiprong approaches in the treatment of addiction and obesity.","Overlapping neuronal circuits in addiction and obesity: evidence of systems pathology.","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

METHODS: Prevalence and correlates of eating disorders from the National Comorbidity Replication, a nationally representative face-to-face household survey (n = 9282), conducted in 2001-2003, were assessed using the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview. RESULTS: Lifetime prevalence estimates of DSM-IV anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder are .9%, 1.5%, and 3.5% among women, and .3% .5%, and 2.0% among men. Survival analysis based on retrospective age-of-onset reports suggests that risk of bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder increased with successive birth cohorts. All 3 disorders are significantly comorbid with many other DSM-IV disorders. Lifetime anorexia nervosa is significantly associated with low current weight (body-mass index <18.5), whereas lifetime binge eating disorder is associated with current severe obesity (body-mass index > or =40). Although most respondents with 12-month bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder report some role impairment (data unavailable for anorexia nervosa since no respondents met criteria for 12-month prevalence), only a minority of cases ever sought treatment.

Neuroimaging studies of GD hold promise in isolating core features of the addiction syndrome, avoiding confounding effects of drug neurotoxicity. At the same time, a neurobiologically-grounded theory of how behaviors like gambling can become addictive remains lacking, posing a significant hurdle for ongoing decisions in addiction nosology. This article integrates research on reward-related brain activity (functional MRI) and neurotransmitter function (PET) in GD, alongside the consideration of structural MRI data as to whether these signals more likely reflect pre-existing vulnerability or neuroadaptive change. Where possible, we point to qualitative similarities and differences with established markers for SUDs. Structural MRI studies indicate modest changes in regional gray matter volume and diffuse reductions in white matter integrity in GD, contrasting with clear structural deterioration in SUDs. Functional MRI studies consistently identify dysregulation in reward-related circuitry (primarily ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex), but evidence is mixed as to the direction of these effects. The need for further parsing of reward sub-processes is emphasized, including anticipation vs outcome, gains vs. losses, and disorder-relevant cues vs natural rewards. Neurotransmitter PET studies indicate amplified dopamine (DA) release in GD, in the context of minimal differences in baseline DA D2 receptor binding, highlighting a distinct profile from SUDs. Preliminary work has investigated further contributions of opioids, GABA and serotonin. Neuroimaging data increasingly highlight divergent profiles in GD vs. SUDs. The ability of gambling to perpetually activate DA (via maximal uncertainty) may contribute to neuroimaging similarities between GD and SUDs, whereas the supra-physiological DA effects of drugs may partly explain differences in the neuroimaging profile of the two syndromes. Coupled with consistent observations of correlations with gambling severity and related clinical variables within GD samples, the overall pattern of effects is interpreted as a likely combination of shared vulnerability markers across GD and SUDs, but with further experience-dependent neuroadaptive processes in GD.","Neuroimaging of reward mechanisms in Gambling disorder: an integrative review.","Molecular psychiatry","Clark L and Boileau I and Zack M","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:15:09,-1,2021-04-07 18:46:09,,,,,,,,

We tested mesolimbic activation effects on neural reward coding.

Some rats were sensitized to amphetamine after training. Electrophysiological activity of ventral pallidal neurons to stimuli was later recorded under the influence of vehicle or acute amphetamine injection. Both sensitization and acute amphetamine increased ventral pallidum firing at CS+2 (population code and rate code). There were no changes at CS+1 and minimal changes to UCS. With a new 'Profile Analysis', we show that mesolimbic activation by sensitization/amphetamine incrementally shifted neuronal firing profiles away from prediction signal coding (maximal at CS+1) and toward incentive coding (maximal at CS+2), without changing hedonic impact coding (maximal at UCS). This pattern suggests mesolimbic activation specifically amplifies a motivational transform of CS+ predictive information into incentive salience coded by ventral pallidal neurons.

These data highlight the importance of early drug exposure and the development of drug dependence; however, little experimental attention has been paid to this phenomenon in animal models of drug abuse. The present experiments demonstrate a progressive and rapid sensitization to the reinforcing strength of cocaine assessed using a progressive ratio (PR) schedule in rats. The first experiment found that rats show increased breakpoints over a 2-week period following acquisition. Subsequent experiments examined the role of total cocaine intake during the initial exposure period and found that low intakes (20 mg/kg/day x 5 days) resulted in sensitization, whereas relatively higher intake (60 or 100 mg/kg/day x 5 days) suppressed the development of sensitization. In contrast, this higher level of intake (60 mg/kg/day x 5 days) only transiently suppressed the expression of sensitization. Examination of breakpoints maintained by various doses of cocaine revealed an upward and leftward displacement of the cocaine dose-effect curve, relative to nonsensitized animals.

In the current experiment, levels of dopamine, serotonin and their metabolites were measured in the medial PFC (n = 12) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (n = 19) of rats using in vivo microdialysis during the delay-discounting model of impulsive choice, where impulsivity is defined as selection of small immediate over larger delayed rewards.

METHODS: Over the course of this project, epidemiological data were collected to determine the prevalence of probable pathological gambling in the general population in each study state and demographic data were collected from pathological gamblers entering treatment programs in each state. RESULTS: Among the states surveyed, the availability of and involvement in gambling differ significantly, as does the prevalence of pathological gambling. Despite these differences, the demographics of pathological gamblers in these states are similar. Like those in the general population, pathological gamblers entering treatment in each state are similar. However, pathological gamblers entering treatment do not represent the full spectrum of individuals in the general population who experience gambling-related problems.

Chronic stressful experiences and caloric restriction are the most powerful triggers of eating disorders in human and animals. Although compulsive behavior is considered to characterize pathological excessive food intake, to our knowledge, no evidence has been reported of continued food seeking/intake despite its possible harmful consequences, an index of compulsive behavior. Brain monoamine transmission is considered to have a key role in vulnerability to eating disorders, and norepinephrine in medial prefrontal cortex has been shown to be critical for food-related motivated behavior.Here, using a new paradigm of conditioned suppression, we investigated whether the ability of a foot-shock-paired conditioned stimulus to suppress chocolate-seeking behavior was reversed by previous exposure to a food restriction experience, thus modeling food seeking in spite of harmful consequences in mice. Moreover, we assessed the effects of selective norepinephrine inactivation in medial prefrontal cortex on conditioned suppression test in stressed and caloric restricted mice. RESULTS: While Control (non food deprived) animals showed a profound conditioned suppression of chocolate seeking during presentation of conditioned stimulus, previously food restricted animals showed food seeking/intake despite its possible harmful consequences. Moreover, food seeking in spite of harmful consequences was prevented by selective norepinephrine inactivation, thus showing that prefrontal cortical norepinephrine is critical also for maladaptive food-related behavior.

However, it is not clear whether impulsivity precedes drug abuse or drug abuse influences impulsivity. OBJECTIVE: The hypothesis of the present experiment was that rats selected for choosing smaller, immediate over larger, delayed food would acquire IV cocaine self-administration faster than those choosing larger, delayed food rewards. METHODS: Female rats were screened for locomotor activity and trained on a delay discounting procedure that allowed them access to two response levers and a food pellet dispenser. Under a fixed-ratio (FR) 1 schedule, responding on one lever resulted in immediate delivery of one 45 mg pellet, while responding on the other lever resulted in delivery of three 45 mg pellets after a variable delay that increased after responses on the delay lever and decreased after responses on the immediate lever. For each rat, a mean adjusted delay (MAD) was calculated for each daily session, and stability was defined as MADs varying less than 5 s across 5 days. Based on their average MADs, rats were separated into low impulsive (LoI) and high impulsive (HiI) groups, implanted with an indwelling IV catheter, and trained to lever press for cocaine (0.2 mg/kg) under an FR1 schedule. RESULTS: There were no differences in locomotor activity between the LoI and HiI groups; however, a greater percentage of the HiI group acquired cocaine self-administration, and they did so at a significantly faster rate than the LoI rats.

Rats received either CHO ad libitum, Fat/Sucrose ad libitum, Fat/Sucrose pair-fed to the caloric intake of CHO, or Fat/Sucrose at 60% of ad libitum Fat/Sucrose intake. Animals receiving Fat/Sucrose ad libitum consumed more calories and gained more weight than animals receiving CHO (P < 0.001). Relative to CHO, ad libitum intake of Fat/Sucrose elevated proDynorphin mRNA levels in the arcuate and Dynorphin A1-17 levels in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) (P < 0.05), but did not affect arcuate mRNA levels of proEnkephalin or proOpiomelanocortin (POMC), or PVN levels of Met-Enkephalin or beta-Endorphin. Pair-feeding the Fat/Sucrose diet to the level of intake of the CHO diet resulted in levels of proDynorphin and Dynorphin A1-17 that were similar in the two diet groups. Pair-feeding Fat/Sucrose reduced mRNA levels of proDynorpin, proEnkephalin and POMC, and Dynorphin A1-17 levels, relative to ad libitum feeding of Fat/Sucrose.

There are three competing explanatory categories: 'liking', learning, and 'wanting'. Does dopamine mostly mediate the hedonic impact of reward ('liking')? Does it instead mediate learned predictions of future reward, prediction error teaching signals and stamp in associative links (learning)? Or does dopamine motivate the pursuit of rewards by attributing incentive salience to reward-related stimuli ('wanting')? Each hypothesis is evaluated here, and it is suggested that the incentive salience or 'wanting' hypothesis of dopamine function may be consistent with more evidence than either learning or 'liking'. In brief, recent evidence indicates that dopamine is neither necessary nor sufficient to mediate changes in hedonic 'liking' for sensory pleasures. Other recent evidence indicates that dopamine is not needed for new learning, and not sufficient to directly mediate learning by causing teaching or prediction signals. By contrast, growing evidence indicates that dopamine does contribute causally to incentive salience. Dopamine appears necessary for normal 'wanting', and dopamine activation can be sufficient to enhance cue-triggered incentive salience. Drugs of abuse that promote dopamine signals short circuit and sensitize dynamic mesolimbic mechanisms that evolved to attribute incentive salience to rewards. Such drugs interact with incentive salience integrations of Pavlovian associative information with physiological state signals. That interaction sets the stage to cause compulsive 'wanting' in addiction, but also provides opportunities for experiments to disentangle 'wanting', 'liking', and learning hypotheses. Results from studies that exploited those opportunities are described here. CONCLUSION: In short, dopamine's contribution appears to be chiefly to cause 'wanting' for hedonic rewards, more than 'liking' or learning for those rewards.","The debate over dopamine's role in reward: the case for incentive salience.","Psychopharmacology","Berridge KC","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:09:33,-1,2021-04-07 18:39:10,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Sprague-Dawley pups were separated from dam for 3 h daily during the first two weeks of birth (maternal separation (MS)), or left undisturbed (non-handled (NH)). Pups were subjected to repeated fasting/refeeding (RF) cycles; that is, 24 h food deprivation and 24 h RF (NH/RF or MS/RF), or had free access to food and water (NH/fed control (FC) or MS/FC) from postnatal day (PND) 28-40. MEASUREMENTS: Body weight gain and food intake were recorded. The arcuate expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and plasma corticosterone levels were analyzed on PND 29 and 40. RESULTS: Decrease in weight gain by repeated fasting/RF cycles was smaller in MS pups than in NH. Interestingly, weight changes responding to fasting or RF increased in MS/RF compared with NH/RF. Compensatory hyperphagia was diminished in NH/RF after the third fasting trial, but persisted in MS/RF throughout the experimental period. The arcuate expression of NPY mRNA responding to food deprivation was blunted, but elevation of plasma corticosterone exaggerated, in the MS group, compared to the NH group, on PND 29 after the first fasting session. However, both the arcuate NPY mRNA and plasma corticosterone levels were increased in MS/RF, but not in NH/RF, on PND 40 after the six sets of fasting/RF cycles, compared to the free FC groups. CONCLUSION: Experience of neonatal MS may lead to an exaggerated feeding response to repeated fasting/RF challenges at adolescence, perhaps, due to increased responsiveness of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal gland axis. Additionally, the results suggested that an increased action of the hypothalamic NPY may not be necessary to induce compensatory hyperphagia following food deprivation.","Sustained hyperphagia in adolescent rats that experienced neonatal maternal separation.","International journal of obesity (2005)","Ryu V and Lee JH and Yoo SB and Gu XF and Moon YW and Jahng JW","",-1,2021-04-11 19:34:10,1,2021-04-02 13:09:25,-1,2021-04-07 19:27:03,,,,,,,,

Despite its importance, the neural systems supporting this ability remain unclear. Here, we investigated this issue using functional imaging to examine neural activity in cigarette smokers, the most prevalent substance-dependent population in the United States, as they used cognitive strategies to regulate craving for cigarettes and food. We found that the cognitive down-regulation of craving was associated with (i) activity in regions previously associated with regulating emotion in particular and cognitive control in general, including dorsomedial, dorsolateral, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices, and (ii) decreased activity in regions previously associated with craving, including the ventral striatum, subgenual cingulate, amygdala, and ventral tegmental area. Decreases in craving correlated with decreases in ventral striatum activity and increases in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity, with ventral striatal activity fully mediating the relationship between lateral prefrontal cortex and reported craving. These results provide insight into the mechanisms that enable cognitive strategies to effectively regulate craving, suggesting that it involves neural dynamics parallel to those involved in regulating other emotions. In so doing, this study provides a methodological tool and conceptual foundation for studying this ability across substance using populations and developing more effective treatments for substance use disorders.","Prefrontal-striatal pathway underlies cognitive regulation of craving.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","Kober H and Mende-Siedlecki P and Kross EF and Weber J and Mischel W and Hart CL and Ochsner KN","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 14:00:02,-1,2021-04-11 19:23:36,,,,,,,,

Pharmacological targets have focused on appetite reduction, although less is understood as to the potential contributions of the stress state during dieting in long-term behavioral modification. In a mouse model of moderate caloric restriction in which a 10-15% weight loss similar to human dieting is produced, we examined physiological and behavioral stress measures. After 3 weeks of restriction, mice showed significant increases in immobile time in a tail suspension test and stress-induced corticosterone levels. Increased stress was associated with brain region-specific alterations of corticotropin-releasing factor expression and promoter methylation, changes that were not normalized with refeeding. Similar outcomes were produced by high-fat diet withdrawal, an additional component of human dieting. In examination of long-term behavioral consequences, previously restricted mice showed a significant increase in binge eating of a palatable high-fat food during stress exposure. Orexigenic hormones, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and orexin, were significantly elevated in response to the high-fat diet only in previously restricted mice. Furthermore, administration of the MCH receptor-1 antagonist GSK-856464 [4-(4-ethyl-5-methylsulfanyl-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)pyridine] significantly reduced total caloric intake in these mice during high-fat access. These results reveal reprogramming of key central pathways involved in regulating stress responsivity and orexigenic drives by moderate caloric restriction experience. In humans, such changes would be expected to reduce treatment success by promoting behaviors resulting in weight regain, and suggest that management of stress during dieting may be beneficial in long-term maintenance.","Caloric restriction experience reprograms stress and orexigenic pathways and promotes binge eating.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Pankevich DE and Teegarden SL and Hedin AD and Jensen CL and Bale TL","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 14:11:17,-1,2021-03-29 18:56:28,,,,,,,,

A peck at a green key produced a reinforcement schedule that was constant within a condition but varied across conditions. A peck at a red key produced a ratio schedule (or, in other conditions, a simple delay) whose size was increased or decreased many times a session, depending on the subject's previous choices. The purpose of these adjustments was to estimate an indifference point--a ratio size (or delay duration) at which the subject chose each key about equally often. The results were used to test a simple 'equivalence rule' for choices between fixed and variable schedules (Mazur, 1984). This rule, which was applied without using free parameters, predicted the major trends in the obtained indifference points from both ratio and delay conditions. However, some small but consistent deviations from the predictions were apparent. Better predictions were generated with a more complex equation, which included parameters reflecting the subjects' sensitivities to delay of reinforcement and to events of different probabilities. It was concluded that a successful equivalence rule must include parameters that can be adjusted to describe the effects of delay and probability in a given experimental setting. Once these parameters are estimated, however, choices involving both fixed and variable delays and fixed and variable ratios can be accurately predicted with the same equation.","Fixed and variable ratios and delays: further tests of an equivalence rule.","Journal of experimental psychology.

Both diseases have profound social, psychological, and economic consequences and are therefore highly relevant for health systems. The high comorbidity indicates some shared underlying neurobiological substrates. Knowing these substrates may increase the understanding of the disease and help identify therapeutic processes. METHOD: Neuroimaging studies of ADHD were reviewed and similarities with SUD identified. For this a PubMed research was conducted with the search terms ADHD, SUD, MRI or positron emission tomography (PET) or spectroscopy or imaging. RESULTS: Similarities were found, in both PET and fMRI studies, between patients with ADHD and those with addiction-related craving. Results from structural MRI and MR spectroscopy do not support a common pathophysiological background, probably because of the lack of studies on craving. DISCUSSION: ADHD and SUD-related craving share some neurobiological similarities. One reason may be that patients with addiction show more craving when they also suffer from ADHD. The present review thus supports the conclusion from an earlier meta-analysis of clinical studies which found that adequate treatment of ADHD reduces craving and relapse into substance use.","Comorbidity of ADHD and Substance Use Disorder (SUD): a neuroimaging perspective.","Journal of attention disorders","Frodl T","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 15:10:22,-1,2021-04-11 19:28:15,,,,,,,,

Dopamine, a neurotransmitter that modulates rewarding properties of food, is likely to be involved. To test the hypothesis that obese individuals have abnormalities in brain dopamine activity we measured the availability of dopamine D2 receptors in brain. METHODS: Brain dopamine D2 receptor availability was measured with positron emission tomography (PET) and [C-11]raclopride (a radioligand for the dopamine D2 receptor). Bmax/Kd (ratio of the distribution volumes in striatum to that in cerebellum minus 1) was used as a measure of dopamine D2 receptor availability. Brain glucose metabolism was also assessed with 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG). FINDINGS: Striatal dopamine D2 receptor availability was significantly lower in the ten obese individuals (2.47 [SD 0.36]) than in controls (2.99 [0.41]; p < or = 0.0075). In the obese individuals body mass index (BMI) correlated negatively with the measures of D2 receptors (r=0.84; p < or = 0.002); the individuals with the lowest D2 values had the largest BMI. By contrast, neither whole brain nor striatal metabolism differed between obese individuals and controls, indicating that striatal reductions in D2 receptors were not due to a systematic reduction in radiotracer delivery. INTERPRETATION: The availability of dopamine D2 receptor was decreased in obese individuals in proportion to their BMI. Dopamine modulates motivation and reward circuits and hence dopamine deficiency in obese individuals may perpetuate pathological eating as a means to compensate for decreased activation of these circuits. Strategies aimed at improving dopamine function may be beneficial in the treatment of obese individuals.","Brain dopamine and obesity.","Lancet (London, England)","Wang GJ and Volkow ND and Logan J and Pappas NR and Wong CT and Zhu W and Netusil N and Fowler JS","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,2021-04-11 19:34:17,-1,2021-04-01 20:08:32,0,2021-04-07 18:11:26,,,,,,,,

Cue-elicited craving for other drugs of abuse is associated with increased activity in a number of brain areas, particularly the reward pathway. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine cue-elicited craving for marijuana. Thirty-eight regular marijuana users abstained from use for 72 h and were presented with tactile marijuana-related and neutral cues while undergoing a fMRI scan. Several structures in the reward pathway, including the ventral tegmental area, thalamus, anterior cingulate, insula, and amygdala, demonstrated greater blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activation in response to the marijuana cue as compared with the neutral cue. These regions underlie motivated behavior and the attribution of incentive salience. Activation of the orbitofrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens was also positively correlated with problems related to marijuana use, such that greater BOLD activation was associated with greater number of items on a marijuana problem scale. Thus, cue-elicited craving for marijuana activates the reward neurocircuitry associated with the neuropathology of addiction, and the magnitude of activation of these structures is associated with severity of cannabis-related problems. These findings may inform the development of treatment strategies for cannabis dependence.","Marijuana craving in the brain.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","Filbey FM and Schacht JP and Myers US and Chavez RS and Hutchison KE","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 15:10:15,-1,2021-04-11 19:28:13,,,,,,,,

Modest doses of addictive drugs can prime motivation for drugs with similar properties. Together, these findings imply that a dose of a psychostimulant drug could prime motivation to gamble in problem gamblers. This study assessed priming effects of oral D-amphetamine (AMPH) (30 mg) in a within-subject, counter-balanced, placebo-controlled design in problem gamblers (n=10), comorbid gamblerdrinkers (n=6), problem drinkers (n=8), and healthy controls (n=12). Modified visual analog scales assessed addictive motivation and subjective effects. A modified rapid reading task assessed pharmacological activation of words from motivationally relevant and irrelevant semantic domains (Gambling, Alcohol, Positive Affect, Negative Affect, Neutral). AMPH increased self-reported motivation for gambling in problem gamblers. Severity of problem gambling predicted positive subjective effects of AMPH and motivation to gamble under the drug. There was little evidence that AMPH directly primed motivation for alcohol in problem drinkers. On the reading task, AMPH produced undifferentiated improvement in reading speed to all word classes in Nongamblers. By contrast, in the two problem gambler groups, AMPH improved reading speed to Gambling words while profoundly slowing reading speed to motivationally irrelevant Neutral words. The latter finding was interpreted as directly congruent with models, which contend that priming of addictive motivation involves a linked suppression of motivationally irrelevant stimuli. This study provides experimental evidence that psychostimulant-like neurochemical activation is an important component of gambling addiction.","Amphetamine primes motivation to gamble and gambling-related semantic networks in problem gamblers.","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Zack M and Poulos CX","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:16:21,-1,2021-04-09 15:33:58,,,,,,,,

Here, we evaluated whether alcohol-preferring C57BL/6J mice develop compulsive alcohol drinking patterns, using adulteration of the alcohol solution with quinine, in a limited access choice paradigm. We assessed 2 independent aspects of compulsive drinking: (i) inflexible alcohol intake by testing whether mice would drink bitter alcohol solutions if this was their only source of alcohol and (ii) indifferent drinking by comparing intake of aversive and nonaversive alcohol solutions. METHODS: Male C57BL/6J mice consumed alcohol for 2 or 8 consecutive weeks. The alcohol solution was then adulterated with graded quinine concentrations, and the effect on alcohol intake was determined. RESULTS: C57BL/6J mice rapidly developed compulsive alcohol drinking patterns. Adulteration of the alcohol solution with an aversive quinine concentration failed to reduce intake, indicative of inflexible drinking behavior, after only 2 weeks of alcohol experience, although quinine adulteration did suppress the acquisition of alcohol drinking in naive mice. After 8 weeks of alcohol consumption, the mice also became indifferent to quinine. They consumed an aversive, quinine-containing alcohol solution, despite the simultaneous availability of an unadulterated alcohol solution. Prolonged alcohol ingestion did not alter the sensitivity to the bitter taste of quinine itself.

Chronic administration of opiates to rodents results in the development of tolerance to their pharmacological effects. Physical dependence also develops and is shown by the appearance of abstinence syndrome. 2. Opiates produce their effects by acting on three types of opiate receptors, namely mu, delta and kappa. The qualitative and quantitative aspects of the tolerance-dependence and abstinence symptoms observed after chronic administration of agonists acting at mu-, delta- and kappa-opiate receptors appear to differ. 3. Tolerance-dependence on mu-opiate agonists, such as morphine, is associated with down-regulation of mu-opiate receptors in spinal cord and specific areas of the brain but delta- and kappa-opiate receptors are unchanged. During abstinence from mu-opiate agonists, brain and spinal cord mu-, delta- and kappa-opiate receptors are unaffected. 4. Chronic administration of kappa-opiate agonists, such as U-50,488H, results in the development of tolerance to its pharmacological effects and a mild degree of physical dependence. Such changes are associated not only with alterations of delta and kappa opiate receptors in brain and spinal cord, but also primarily with a down-regulation of kappa-opiate receptors in spinal cord and specific brain regions. mu-Opiate receptors are unaffected. 5. Chronic administration of delta-opiate agonists results in down-regulation of brain delta-opiate receptors. 6. It is concluded that tolerance-dependence on mu-, delta- and kappa-opiate receptors is associated with down-regulation of their own type of receptors in the spinal and supraspinal areas.

However, whether this association is specific to drugs of abuse or whether heightened impulsivity relates to a general increase in sensitivity to rewards and reward-associated stimuli is unknown. To address this issue, the authors selected rats on the basis of individual differences in impulsive action in the 5-choice serial reaction time task, after which they were subjected to an operant sucrose self-administration paradigm. High-impulsive rats displayed a progressive increase in responding on the active hole (including responses emitted during the time-out period) in comparison with low-impulsive rats, which reflects escalation of sucrose-seeking behavior. Once sucrose and sucrose-associated stimuli were omitted (extinction training), nose-poke responding ceased rapidly, an effect that was independent of impulsivity level. In contrast, on reintroduction of sucrose-associated stimuli, sucrose seeking was successfully reinstated in high-impulsive but not in low-impulsive rats. Collectively, the results suggest that impaired response inhibition is associated with enhanced responsiveness to reward-associated stimuli. As such, elevated impulsivity might constitute a risk factor for the initiation and maintenance of addictive behaviors.","Trait impulsivity predicts escalation of sucrose seeking and hypersensitivity to sucrose-associated stimuli.","Behavioral neuroscience","Diergaarde L and Pattij T and Nawijn L and Schoffelmeer AN and De Vries TJ","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 14:47:03,-1,2021-04-03 21:45:23,,,,,,,,

Methadone has been the standard medication for the management of heroin craving. OBJECTIVES: We explored the medication options other than methadone which may have heroin anticraving properties. METHODS: To be selected for the review, articles had to include outcome measures of the effect of the studied medication on subjective and/or objective opiate craving and be of the following two types: (1) randomized, controlled, and/or double-blind clinical trials (RCTs) examining the relationship between the studied medication and heroin craving; (2) nonrandomized and observational studies (NRSs) examining the relationship between the studied medication and heroin craving. Thirty-three articles were initially included in the review. Twenty-one were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. We present the results of 12 articles that met all the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Some new medications have been under investigation and seem promising for the treatment of opiate craving. Buprenorphine is the second most studied medication after methadone for its effect on opiate craving. At doses above 8 mg daily, it seems very promising and practical for managing opiate craving in patients receiving long-term opioid maintenance treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: In doses higher than 8 mg daily, buprenorphine is an appropriate treatment for opiate craving. More research with rigorous methodology is needed to study the effect of buprenorphine on heroin craving.

Animal gambling models, however, have not yet demonstrated the compulsivity so characteristic of drug addiction. Three criteria have been used to evaluate addiction-like behavior in drug models: (1) response inhibition when reward is not available, (2) persistence under a progressive ratio schedule, in which the response-to-reward ratio is stretched, and (3) persistence in spite of punishment. We tested whether prolonged exposure (6 weeks) to a gambling-like reward schedule would induce addiction-like symptoms in rats. In two studies, separate groups were trained to respond to either random- or fixed-ratio schedules for food reward. We found that rats trained on random-ratio schedules showed higher response rates and dramatically shorter pauses after rewards. Tests of addiction-like behavior, however, were largely negative. Response rates were not different during cued no-reward periods nor when reward was coupled with punishment. We also found no group differences when food was devalued nor in reinstatement of reward-seeking after a 1-week delay. The sole exception to this pattern was that rats in the second experiment showed greater persistence on a progressive ratio test. After experiment two, subjects were also orally administered pramipexole, which caused increased perseveration during progressive ratio testing, especially in the random ratio group. While, it is possible that longer training or more appetitive rewards might have led to addiction-like behavior, our results, on the surface, suggest that random-ratio schedules are motivating but not addictive.","Can Slot-Machine Reward Schedules Induce Gambling Addiction in Rats?","Journal of gambling studies","Laskowski CS and Dorchak DL and Ward KM and Christensen DR and Euston DR","",1,2021-04-01 15:50:09,0,2021-03-26 19:08:48,1,2021-03-29 18:59:40,,,,,,,,

They were pair-housed and half were tail-marked for identification. Anxiety/stress profiles were unaffected by cage-cleaning frequency, suggesting that commercial-typical differences in husbandry contribute little variance to adult rat behavior. However, delivery batch affected some elevated plus-maze measures. Also, tail-marked rats spent three times longer on the plus-maze open arms than their unmarked cagemates, suggesting reduced anxiety, yet paradoxically they showed greater chromodacryorrhoea responses to handling, implying increased aversion to human contact. A follow-up study showed that rats avoided the odor released from the marker pen used. Thus, apparently trivial aspects of procedure can greatly affect experimental results.","Marked for life?

OBJECTIVES: This study examined whether regular smokers are more impulsive than never smokers using personality and behavioral measures of impulsivity. METHODS: Twenty regular smokers (>/=15 cigarettes/day) and 20 never smokers were recruited. Participants completed five personality questionnaires to assess impulsivity: Adjective Checklist, Barratt's Impulsivity Scale, the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire, Eysenck's Personality Questionnaire, and the Sensation-Seeking Scale. Participants also performed three behavioral choice tasks designed to assess impulsivity. In the delay task, participants chose between small, immediate and large, delayed monetary rewards. Impulsivity was defined as a relative preference for the small, immediate alternative. In the probability task, participants chose between small, certain and large, uncertain monetary rewards. Impulsivity was defined as a relative preference for the large but more risky alternative. In the work task, participants chose between small monetary rewards obtained by performing a negligible amount of work and a larger amount of money requiring more work. Impulsivity was defined as a relative preference for the smaller, easier alternative. RESULTS: On the personality questionnaires, smokers had statistically higher impulsivity scores on most scales. On the behavioral choice tasks, smokers chose small, immediate money over large, delayed money more frequently, signifying greater levels of impulsivity. There were no differences between the groups' choices on the other tasks. Correlations between questionnaire and task data were small, as were correlations between data from each task.

By estimating the likelihood of future events, it is possible to prepare appropriate actions in advance and execute fast, accurate motor responses.

Several neuromodulators have been linked to uncertainty signalling, but comprehensive empirical characterisation of their relative contributions to perceptual belief updating, and to the selection of motor responses, is lacking. Here we assess the roles of noradrenaline, acetylcholine, and dopamine within a single, unified computational framework of uncertainty. Using pharmacological interventions in a sample of 128 healthy human volunteers and a hierarchical Bayesian learning model, we characterise the influences of noradrenergic, cholinergic, and dopaminergic receptor antagonism on individual computations of uncertainty during a probabilistic serial reaction time task. We propose that noradrenaline influences learning of uncertain events arising from unexpected changes in the environment. In contrast, acetylcholine balances attribution of uncertainty to chance fluctuations within an environmental context, defined by a stable set of probabilistic associations, or to gross environmental violations following a contextual switch.

OBJECTIVE: To study the functional activity in neural circuits that subserve self-regulatory control in women with BN. DESIGN: We compared functional magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygenation level-dependent responses in patients with BN with healthy controls during performance of the Simon Spatial Incompatibility task. SETTING: University research institute. PARTICIPANTS: Forty women: 20 patients with BN and 20 healthy control participants. Main Outcome Measure We used general linear modeling of Simon Spatial Incompatibility task-related activations to compare groups on their patterns of brain activation associated with the successful or unsuccessful engagement of self-regulatory control. RESULTS: Patients with BN responded more impulsively and made more errors on the task than did healthy controls; patients with the most severe symptoms made the most errors. During correct responding on incongruent trials, patients failed to activate frontostriatal circuits to the same degree as healthy controls in the left inferolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area [BA] 45), bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (BA 44), lenticular and caudate nuclei, and anterior cingulate cortex (BA 24/32). Patients activated the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (BA 32) more when making errors than when responding correctly. In contrast, healthy participants activated the anterior cingulate cortex more during correct than incorrect responses, and they activated the striatum more when responding incorrectly, likely reflecting an automatic response tendency that, in the absence of concomitant anterior cingulate cortex activity, produced incorrect responses. CONCLUSIONS: Self-regulatory processes are impaired in women with BN, likely because of their failure to engage frontostriatal circuits appropriately. These findings enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of BN by pointing to functional abnormalities within a neural system that subserves self-regulatory control, which may contribute to binge eating and other impulsive behaviors in women with BN.","Deficient activity in the neural systems that mediate self-regulatory control in bulimia nervosa.","Archives of general psychiatry","Marsh R and Steinglass JE and Gerber AJ and Graziano O'Leary K and Wang Z and Murphy D and Walsh BT and Peterson BS","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:54:38,-1,2021-04-11 19:13:19,,,,,,,,

Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of anxiety and depression, and it may also be involved in the acute behavioral and neuroendocrine actions of cocaine. The role of endogenous CRF in cocaine withdrawal-induced anxiety was investigated in the present study. Animals were subjected to chronic cocaine (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, once a day for 14 days) administration. Rats tested 30 min after the last cocaine injection did not show withdrawal anxiety on the elevated plus maze or any alterations in brain CRF levels. Withdrawal (48 h) from chronic cocaine administration produced an intense anxiety-like behavior characterized by decreased open arm exploration. Immunoreactive CRF (CRF-LI) levels were selectively altered in the hypothalamus, in the amygdala and in the basal forebrain structures at the time of the behavioral anxiety, reflecting an increased activity of brain CRF systems. Daily intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) pretreatment with an immunoserum raised against CRF completely prevented the development of anxiety induced by cocaine withdrawal. These data suggest that extrahypothalamic-limbic CRF hypersecretion may be involved in the development of anxiety related to cocaine withdrawal and that the CRF system may be a useful target for new pharmacotherapies for cocaine withdrawal and relapse.","Brain corticotropin-releasing factor mediates 'anxiety-like' behavior induced by cocaine withdrawal in rats.","Brain research","Sarnyai Z and Biro E and Gardi J and Vecsernyes M and Julesz J and Telegdy G","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 18:15:19,-1,2021-04-06 18:39:26,,,,,,,,

These have used both clinical diagnoses and eating disorder-related intermediate phenotypes such as drive-for-thinness or body dissatisfaction.

Data in rats suggest that activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is suppressed by consumption of a high sucrose diet, and is increased with exposure to a high fat diet. Additionally, the choice to consume a highly palatable food following exposure to a stressor results in reduced corticosterone levels. To test the effects of intermittent access to a high sugar/high fat food on stress hormone levels, rats were given either unrestricted (UR) access to a sucrose-vegetable shortening mixture (SVS) or 2 hour SVS access 7 days (7D) or 3 days (3D) per week for 4 weeks. Rats on the UR and 3D schedules consumed significantly more calories per day than did controls with no access to SVS, and the 7D and 3D rats consumed as many SVS calories in the 2 hour access period as did the UR rats with 24 hour access to SVS. After 4 weeks of access to SVS (UR, 7D, and 3D), rats were briefly restrained. Control and UR rats had elevated corticosterone during and following restraint, whereas there were no differences in corticosterone levels of 7D and 3D rats in response to restraint, as compared to baseline. Post-restraint consumption of chow was significantly decreased in all groups, and consumption of SVS was reduced in the UR, but not the 7D and 3D rats. These data demonstrate that intermittent access to SVS dampens the corticosterone response to restraint stress and that stressful events do not induce bingeing in non-bingeing animals with access to a high sucrose/high fat food.","Binge-type eating attenuates corticosterone and hypophagic responses to restraint stress.","Physiology & behavior","Kinzig KP and Hargrave SL and Honors MA","",1,,1,2021-03-28 14:03:31,1,2021-03-29 19:01:14,,,,,,,,

The introduction sketches the results of earlier studies with local drug injections and selective neurotoxins which provided pharmacological evidence that monoamines can influence food intake and body weight. A table summarizing this evidence is used to list monoamine changes that could underlie anorexia or hyperphagia. It is apparent that abnormalities in the monoamines, along with their cotransmitters, could cause many forms of feeding disorder. It is proposed as a working hypothesis that several varieties of hyperphagia leading to obesity have a common element. This common factor is a change in excitability of a lateral hypothalamic reinforcement system as manifested in self-stimulation at a stimulation-bound feeding site. Understanding this feeding reward-aversion system helps us understand hyperphagia and anorexia. The neurochemistry of reward and aversion involves the monoamines. This paper focuses on dopamine and serotonin. The data support the hypothesis that dopamine systems projecting to the nucleus accumbens and other forebrain areas from the mid-brain ventral tegmental area (VTA) are important for approach and positive reinforcement in ingestive behavior and self-stimulation. Serotonin is hypothesized to facilitate satiety and inhibition of feeding reward in the hypothalamus. The next section abstracts our recent experiments that measured pharmacological and physiological release of the monoamines in the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens during ingestive behavior and self-stimulation. In vivo microdialysis in freely moving rats suggested the following: (1) Norepinephrine was released in the paraventricular nucleus during the active, feeding period of the circadian cycle. (2) The serotonin metabolite 5-HIAA also increased in the PVN at the same time if there was food to eat. (3) Amphetamine infused into the lateral hypothalamus (LH) by reverse dialysis increased synaptic dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. (4) The anorectic drug d-fenfluramine increased synaptic serotonin in the LH and also increased the dopamine metabolite DOPAC, suggesting that serotonin and dopamine in the LH might contribute to fenfluramine-induced satiety. Local d-fenfluramine injection into the LH or local infusion by reverse dialysis again increased serotonin and decreased 5-HIAA and interfered with local dopamine metabolism as reflected in decreased DOPAC and HVA. (5) Tryptophan, a serotonin precursor, given systemically at an anorectic dose, increased extracellular serotonin in the LH, but this effect was only detectable in food-deprived rats. This was seemingly pH independent (between 5.8 and 8). The passage other cations through CFo is strictly suppressed (even at pH 8 and with 300 mM NaCl in the medium).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","Microdialysis studies of brain norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine release during ingestive behavior.

Brain mu-opioid systems contribute crucially to both forms of food reward. Yet, opioid signals for food 'liking' and 'wanting' diverge in anatomical substrates, in pathways connecting these sites, and in the firing profiles of single neurons. Divergent neural control of hedonic and motivational processes raises the possibility for joint or separable modulation of food intake in human disorders associated with excessive eating and obesity. Early findings confirm an important role for 'liking' and 'wanting' in human appetitive behaviors, and suggest the intriguing possibility that exaggerated signals for 'wanting,' and perhaps 'liking,' may contribute to forms of overeating.","Hedonic and motivational roles of opioids in food reward: implications for overeating disorders.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior","Pecina S and Smith KS","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:27:13,-1,2021-04-09 15:52:28,,,,,,,,

During gambling, players experience a range of cognitive distortions that promote an overestimation of the chances of winning. Near-miss outcomes are thought to fuel these distortions. We observed previously that near misses recruited overlapping circuitry to monetary wins in a study in healthy volunteers (Clark et al., 2009). The present study sought to extend these observations in regular gamblers and relate brain responses to an index of gambling severity. Twenty regular gamblers, who varied in their involvement from recreational playing to probable pathological gambling, were scanned while performing a simplified slot machine task that delivered occasional monetary wins, as well as near-miss and full-miss nonwin outcomes. In the overall group, near-miss outcomes were associated with a significant response in the ventral striatum, which was also recruited by monetary wins. Gambling severity, measured with the South Oaks Gambling Screen, predicted a greater response in the dopaminergic midbrain to near-miss outcomes. This effect survived controlling for clinical comorbidities that were present in the regular gamblers. Gambling severity did not predict win-related responses in the midbrain or elsewhere. These results demonstrate that near-miss events during gambling recruit reward-related brain circuitry in regular players. An association with gambling severity in the midbrain suggests that near-miss outcomes may enhance dopamine transmission in disordered gambling, which extends neurobiological similarities between pathological gambling and drug addiction.","Gambling severity predicts midbrain response to near-miss outcomes.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Chase HW and Clark L","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:12:30,-1,2021-04-07 18:40:45,,,,,,,,

Although emerging evidence implicates the endogenous cannabinoid system in aspects of opioid and ethanol addiction, a role of the endocannabinoid system in cocaine addiction remains widely inconclusive. Here, we investigate the effects of systemic and intra-accumbal administration of the CB1 antagonist SR141716A (Rimonabant) on cocaine self-administration (0.5 mg/kg/infusion) under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule in rats with extended [long access (LgA); 6 h/d] or limited [short access (ShA); 1 h/d] access to cocaine. LgA rats, but not ShA rats, showed an increase in cocaine intake as previously reported, and responding for cocaine by LgA rats was higher than in ShA rats under a PR schedule. Systemic SR141716A induced a dramatic dose-dependent decrease in the breakpoint for cocaine by LgA rats, whereas only the highest dose of the antagonist had a significant effect in the ShA group. Anandamide levels in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell were decreased in ShA rats but unchanged in LgA rats during cocaine self-administration. Both phosphorylated and total CB1 receptor protein expression were upregulated in LgA rats in the NAc and the amygdala compared with ShA and drug-naive rats, 24 h after last cocaine session. Finally, intra-NAc infusions of SR141716A reduced cocaine breakpoints selectively in LgA animals. These results suggest that neuroadaptations in the endogenous cannabinoid system may be part of the neuroplasticity associated with the development of cocaine addiction.","A role for the endocannabinoid system in the increased motivation for cocaine in extended-access conditions.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Orio L and Edwards S and George O and Parsons LH and Koob GF","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 02:00:02,-1,2021-04-06 18:49:14,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The fMRI activation patterns in right insular, posterior cingulate, and temporal cortex obtained early in recovery correctly predicted 20 of 22 subjects who did not relapse and 17 of 18 subjects who did. A Cox regression analysis revealed that the combination of right middle frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and posterior cingulate activation best predicted the time to relapse.

However, the cell type and brain region in which NMDAR signaling is required for AMPH sensitization remain unresolved. Here we use selective inactivation of Grin1, the gene encoding the essential NR1 subunit of NMDARs, in dopamine neurons or their medium spiny neuron (MSN) targets, to address this issue. We show that NMDAR signaling in dopamine neurons is not required for behavioral sensitization to AMPH. Conversely, removing NMDARs from MSNs that express the dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) significantly attenuated AMPH sensitization, and conditional, virus-mediated restoration of NR1 in D1R neurons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of these animals rescued sensitization. Interestingly, sensitization could also be restored by virus-mediated inactivation of NR1 in all remaining neurons in the NAc of animals lacking NMDARs on D1R neurons, or by removing NMDARs from all MSNs. Taken together, these data indicate that unbalanced loss of NMDAR signaling in D1R MSNs alone prevents AMPH sensitization, whereas a balanced loss of NMDARs from both D1R and dopamine D2 receptor-expressing (D2R) MSNs is permissive for sensitization.","Balanced NMDA receptor activity in dopamine D1 receptor (D1R)- and D2R-expressing medium spiny neurons is required for amphetamine sensitization.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","Beutler LR and Wanat MJ and Quintana A and Sanz E and Bamford NS and Zweifel LS and Palmiter RD","Drug-related intermittent or continuous access",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 15:10:28,-1,2021-04-11 19:28:16,,,,,,,,

We consider four features of experimentation in economics, namely, script enactment, repeated trials, performance-based monetary payments, and the proscription against deception, and compare them to experimental practices in psychology, primarily in the area of behavioral decision making. Whereas economists bring a precisely defined 'script' to experiments for participants to enact, psychologists often do not provide such a script, leaving participants to infer what choices the situation affords. By often using repeated experimental trials, economists allow participants to learn about the task and the environment; psychologists typically do not. Economists generally pay participants on the basis of clearly defined performance criteria; psychologists usually pay a flat fee or grant a fixed amount of course credit. Economists virtually never deceive participants; psychologists, especially in some areas of inquiry, often do. We argue that experimental standards in economics are regulatory in that they allow for little variation between the experimental practices of individual researchers. The experimental standards in psychology, by contrast, are comparatively laissez-faire. We believe that the wider range of experimental practices in psychology reflects a lack of procedural regularity that may contribute to the variability of empirical findings in the research fields under consideration. We conclude with a call for more research on the consequences of methodological preferences, such as the use on monetary payments, and propose a 'do-it-both-ways' rule regarding the enactment of scripts, repetition of trials, and performance-based monetary payments. We also argue, on pragmatic grounds, that the default practice should be not to deceive participants.","Experimental practices in economics: a methodological challenge for psychologists?","The Behavioral and brain sciences","Hertwig R and Ortmann A","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:52:09,-1,2021-04-11 19:07:17,,,,,,,,

Whether these changes are a cause of addiction or its consequence is unknown. We investigated whether the development of an addiction-like behavior in the rat is associated with the pattern of cocaine intake and with cocaine craving, a major feature of cocaine addiction. METHODS: To determine whether changes in the pattern of cocaine use and enhanced craving precede or parallel the onset of addiction, we used a rat addiction model that incorporates core features of human addiction. For this purpose, the pattern of inter-infusion intervals (a measure of pattern of cocaine intake), sensitivity to cocaine-induced reinstatement (a measure of cocaine craving), and addiction-like behaviour were assessed over several months of intravenous cocaine self-administration. RESULTS: We found that, even at early stages of cocaine self-administration, both the pattern of cocaine intake and the intensity of drug-induced reinstatement predict the severity of cocaine use, measured after 75 days of self-administration. CONCLUSIONS: Our results identify key predictors of cocaine addiction-intensified pattern of drug use and high drug-induced craving-that may help in the identification of subjects at risk for subsequent development of severe cocaine addiction.","Pattern of intake and drug craving predict the development of cocaine addiction-like behavior in rats.","Biological psychiatry","Belin D and Balado E and Piazza PV and Deroche-Gamonet V","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 01:57:48,-1,2021-04-06 18:48:35,,,,,,,,

'Deprivation-effect' paradigms, whereby abstinence from a substance results in enhanced intake, are often used to measure 'craving' for drugs of abuse, such as alcohol. The present study used operant conditioning to investigate consumption of sugar after abstinence in rats selected for glucose avidity. The experimental group was trained on a fixed ratio (FR-1) schedule for 25% glucose for 30 min/day for 28 days and also had glucose access in the home cages for an additional 11.5 h daily. The control group had only the 30-min/day access to glucose in the operant chambers. Then, both groups were deprived of glucose for 2 weeks. After this period of abstinence, animals were put back in the operant chambers. The experimental group responded significantly more than ever before, and significantly more than the control group. In conclusion, daily 12-h access to sugar, in the paradigm used, can result in an altered neural state that lasts throughout 2 weeks of abstinence, leading to enhanced intake. Together with previous results, this deprivation effect supports the theory that animals may become dependent on sugar under selected dietary circumstances.","Sugar-dependent rats show enhanced responding for sugar after abstinence: evidence of a sugar deprivation effect.","Physiology & behavior","Avena NM and Long KA and Hoebel BG","",1,,1,2021-03-28 16:28:17,1,2021-04-03 21:50:33,,,,,,,,

Uncertainty can increase the attractiveness for predictors of reward in the Pavlovian procedure of autoshaping, visible as enhanced sign-tracking (or approach and nibbles) by rats of a metal lever whose sudden appearance acts as a conditioned stimulus (CS+) to predict sucrose pellets as an unconditioned stimulus (UCS). Here we examined how reward uncertainty might enhance incentive salience as sign-tracking both in intensity and by broadening the range of attractive CS+s. We also examined whether initially induced uncertainty enhancements of CS+ attraction can endure beyond uncertainty itself, and persist even when Pavlovian prediction becomes 100% certain. Our results show that uncertainty can broaden incentive salience attribution to make CS cues attractive that would otherwise not be (either because they are too distal from reward or too risky to normally attract sign-tracking). In addition, uncertainty enhancement of CS+ incentive salience, once induced by initial exposure, persisted even when Pavlovian CS-UCS correlations later rose toward 100% certainty in prediction. Persistence suggests an enduring incentive motivation enhancement potentially relevant to gambling, which in some ways resembles incentive-sensitization. Higher motivation to uncertain CS+s leads to more potent attraction to these cues when they predict the delivery of uncertain rewards. In humans, those cues might possibly include the sights and sounds associated with gambling, which contribute a major component of the play immersion experienced by problematic gamblers.","Initial uncertainty in Pavlovian reward prediction persistently elevates incentive salience and extends sign-tracking to normally unattractive cues.","Behavioural brain research","Robinson MJ and Anselme P and Fischer AM and Berridge KC","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:18:45,-1,2021-04-09 15:45:47,,,,,,,,

Animal research that manipulates ovarian hormone status and examines individual differences in extreme binge eating proneness is needed to model clinical phenotypes in humans and to confirm causal effects. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of adult ovariectomy on overall binge eating risk and extreme binge eating phenotypes using the binge eating resistant (BER)/binge eating prone (BEP) rat model. We predicted that palatable food consumption would significantly increase after ovariectomy in all rats because ovarian hormones generally suppress food intake. If differences in responsiveness to ovarian hormones underlie BER/BEP phenotypes, then differences in binge eating between BER and BEP rats would be eliminated or diminished after ovariectomy. Changes in palatable food (PF) intake were compared in BER and BEP rats before and after ovariectomy in two samples of adult females. Findings were highly similar in the two samples. PF intake increased significantly following ovariectomy in all rats. However, BEP rats consistently consumed larger amounts of PF than BER rats, both before and after ovariectomy. The consistency of findings across two samples of rats provides strong support for activational effects of ovarian hormones on binge eating. However, the immunity of extreme binge eating phenotypes to ovarian hormone ablation suggests that other, earlier mechanisms (e.g., organizational hormone effects or hormone-independent effects) determine the expression of binge eating phenotypes.","The effects of ovariectomy on binge eating proneness in adult female rats.","Hormones and behavior","Klump KL and Suisman JL and Culbert KM and Kashy DA and Keel PK and Sisk CL","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 18:03:22,-1,2021-04-03 21:51:46,,,,,,,,

Ingestive behavior, however, has not been extensively studied in aging models. The present research used young, middle-aged and old rats to examine food intake under several different schedules of optional fat availability. All rats were provided with continuous access to a nutritionally complete diet throughout the 6-week study. In addition, different subgroups within each age had access to an optional source of vegetable shortening under schedules in which the frequency of access was manipulated: controls (C)-- no shortening access; MWF--2-h shortening access on Monday, Wednesday and Friday; D2--2-h shortening access every day; D24--24-h shortening access every day. Energy intake was significantly greater in groups with more frequent access to shortening regardless of age. The length of time the rats remained hyperphagic, however, increased with age. Body weight increased significantly in the D24 group in middle-aged and old rats, but not in young rats. Total body fat was also significantly higher in middle-aged and old groups with more frequent access to shortening, but not in young rats. Finally, body ash mass was significantly reduced in old rats on the D24 diet.

It provides an animal model for the intensification of drug craving believed to underlie addiction in humans. Mechanistic similarities between sensitization and other forms of neuronal plasticity were first suggested on the basis of the ability of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists to prevent the development of sensitization [Karler, R., Calder, L. D., Chaudhry, I. A. and Turkanis, S. A. (1989) Blockade of 'reverse tolerance' to cocaine and amphetamine by MK-801. Life Sci., 45, 599-606]. This article will review the large number of subsequent studies addressing: (1) the roles of NMDA, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) and metabotropic glutamate receptors in the development and expression of behavioral sensitization, (2) excitatory amino acids (EAAs) and the role of conditioning in sensitization, (3) controversies regarding EAA involvement in behavioral sensitization based on studies with MK-801, (4) the effects of acute and repeated stimulant administration on EAA neurochemistry and EAA receptor expression, and (5) the neuroanatomy of EAA involvement in sensitization. To summarize, NMDA, AMPA metabotropic glutamate receptors all participate in the development of sensitization, while maintenance of the sensitized state involves alterations in neurochemical measures of EAA transmission as well as in the expression and sensitivity of AMPA and NMDA receptors. While behavioral sensitization likely involves complex neuronal circuits, with EAAs participating at several points within this circuitry, EAA projections originating in prefrontal cortex may play a particularly important role in the development of sensitization, perhaps via their regulatory effects on midbrain dopamine neurons. The review concludes by critically evaluating various hypotheses to account for EAA involvement in the development of behavioral sensitization, and considering the question of whether EAA receptors are involved in mediating the rewarding effects of psychomotor stimulants and sensitization of such rewarding effects.","The role of excitatory amino acids in behavioral sensitization to psychomotor stimulants.","Progress in neurobiology","Wolf ME","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 15:12:19,-1,2021-04-11 19:28:44,,,,,,,,

The present study investigated whether restricted access to a highly palatable combination of sugar and fat, without food deprivation, would instigate binge eating and also increase body weight. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Male rats were maintained for 25 days on one of four diets: (i) sweet-fat chow for 2 h/day followed by ad libitum standard chow, (ii) 2-h sweet-fat chow only 3 days/week and access to standard chow the rest of the time, (iii) ad libitum sweet-fat chow, or (iv) ad libitum standard chow. RESULTS: Both groups with 2-h access to the sweet-fat chow exhibited bingeing behavior, as defined by excessively large meals. The body weight of these animals increased due to large meals and then decreased between binges as a result of self-restricted intake of standard chow following binges. However, despite these fluctuations in body weight, the group with 2-h access to sweet-fat chow every day gained significantly more weight than the control group with standard chow available ad libitum. DISCUSSION: These findings may have implications for the body weight fluctuations associated with binge-eating disorder, as well as the relationship between binge eating and the obesity epidemic.","Bingeing, self-restriction, and increased body weight in rats with limited access to a sweet-fat diet.","Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)","Berner LA and Avena NM and Hoebel BG","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc)",-1,,-1,2021-03-26 19:09:50,-1,2021-03-29 19:21:59,,,,,,,,

Recent primate electrophysiological studies using concepts from information, economic and learning theories indicate that the midbrain may code two statistical parameters of reward information: a transient reward error prediction signal that varies linearly with reward probability and a sustained signal that varies highly non-linearly with reward probability and that is highest with maximal reward uncertainty (reward probability = 0.5). Here, using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we disentangled these two signals in humans using a novel paradigm that systematically varied monetary reward probability, magnitude and expected reward value. The midbrain was activated both transiently with the error prediction signal and in a sustained fashion with reward uncertainty. Moreover, distinct activity dynamics were observed in post-synaptic midbrain projection sites: the prefrontal cortex responded to the transient error prediction signal while the ventral striatum covaried with the sustained reward uncertainty signal. These data suggest that the prefrontal cortex may generate the reward prediction while the ventral striatum may be involved in motivational processes that are useful when an organism needs to obtain more information about its environment.

In Wistar rats, this period lasts about half a year. During the next few months, the consumption of ethanol rises without a concomitant loss of its behavioral effects. After an abstinence period of nine months, the rats maintain a high preference for alcohol which cannot be suppressed by adulteration with (unpleasantly tasting) quinine. Ethanol-taking behavior can no longer be modified by external stimuli or by dominance rank. This irreversible state is called 'behavioral dependence.' It is drug-specific (i.e., other drugs like diazepam cannot substitute the alcohol) and not related to physical dependence.

We also address methodological issues related to the use of the reinstatement model to study relapse to food seeking, similarities and differences in mechanisms underlying reinstatement of food seeking versus drug seeking, and the degree to which the reinstatement procedure provides a suitable model for studying relapse in humans. We conclude by discussing implications for medication development and future research. We offer three tentative conclusions: (1)The neuronal mechanisms of food-priming- and cue-induced reinstatement are likely different from those of reinstatement induced by the pharmacological stressor yohimbine.

RESULTS: Patients showed meaningful ACC patterns of activation, less recruitment for response anticipation, and abnormal for response conflict, when they had to suppress an inappropriate response.

METHODS: Eight women with bulimia nervosa and 8 female controls underwent brain MRI followed by (11)C-carfentanil PET. Voxel-based methods were used to assess group differences in mu-OR binding between controls and bulimic subjects and to correlate mu-OR binding with the frequency of recent self-reported abnormal eating behaviors in bulimic subjects. RESULTS: mu-OR binding in the left insular cortex was less in bulimic subjects than in controls and correlated negatively with recent fasting behavior. CONCLUSION: Changes in mu-OR binding in the insula may be important in the pathogenesis or maintenance of the self-perpetuating behavioral cycle of bulimic subjects because the insula is the primary gustatory cortex and has repeatedly been implicated in the processing of the reward value of food.","Regional mu-opioid receptor binding in insular cortex is decreased in bulimia nervosa and correlates inversely with fasting behavior.","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine","Bencherif B and Guarda AS and Colantuoni C and Ravert HT and Dannals RF and Frost JJ","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 14:47:51,-1,2021-04-11 19:23:55,,,,,,,,

Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analyses showed that the sight of chocolate produced more activation in chocolate cravers than non-cravers in the medial orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum. For cravers vs. non-cravers, a combination of a picture of chocolate with chocolate in the mouth produced a greater effect than the sum of the components (i.e. supralinearity) in the medial orbitofrontal cortex and pregenual cingulate cortex. Furthermore, the pleasantness ratings of the chocolate and chocolate-related stimuli had higher positive correlations with the fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent signals in the pregenual cingulate cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex in the cravers than in the non-cravers.

The concept of food addiction has been controversial historically due to definitional and conceptual difficulties and to a lack of rigorous scientific data. RECENT FINDINGS: Support for the food addiction hypothesis comes from alterations in neurochemistry (dopamine, endogenous opioids), neuroanatomy (limbic system), and self-medication behaviors. Foods identified as having potential addictive properties include sweets, carbohydrates, fats, sweet/fat combinations, and possibly processed and/or high salt foods. Eating topography has been identified as a necessary factor in neural pathway changes that promote addiction-like properties in response to some foods. A recently developed food addiction scale shows promise in identifying food addiction. SUMMARY: Recent findings have strengthened the case for food addiction. These findings may serve to validate the perception of food addiction in patients and inform psychoeducational, cognitive-behavioral, and/or pharmacological treatment for chronic food cravings, compulsive overeating, and binge eating that may represent a phenotype of obesity. Screening for food addiction has the potential to identify people with eating difficulties that seriously compromise weight management efforts. Future research should include a focus on human food addiction research; evaluating the impact of treatment on underlying neurochemistry; and prevention or reversal of food addiction in humans.","Food addiction: true or false?","Current opinion in gastroenterology","Corsica JA and Pelchat ML","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 18:14:35,-1,2021-04-03 21:52:53,,,,,,,,

Opioid peptides within the ventral striatum are thought to play a key role in the latter function, regulating the affective response to highly palatable, energy-dense foods such as those containing fat and sugar. It has been shown previously that stimulation of mu opiate receptors within the ventral striatum increases intake of palatable food. In the present study, we examined enkephalin peptide gene expression within the striatum in rats that had been given restricted daily access to an energy-dense, palatable liquid food, chocolate Ensure(R). Rats maintained on an ad libitum diet of rat chow and water were given 3-h access to Ensure(R) daily for two weeks. One day following the end of this period, preproenkephalin gene expression was measured with quantitative in situ hybridization. Compared with control animals, rats that had been exposed to Ensure(R) had significantly reduced enkephalin gene expression in several striatal regions including the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens), a finding that was confirmed in a different group with Northern blot analysis. Rats fed this regimen of Ensure(R) did not differ in weight from controls. In contrast to chronic Ensure(R), acute ingestion of Ensure(R) did not appear to affect enkephalin peptide gene expression. These results suggest that repeated consumption of a highly rewarding, energy-dense food induces neuroadaptations in cognitive-motivational circuits.","Restricted daily consumption of a highly palatable food (chocolate Ensure(R)) alters striatal enkephalin gene expression.","The European journal of neuroscience","Kelley AE and Will MJ and Steininger TL and Zhang M and Haber SN","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc)",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 14:41:36,-1,2021-04-03 21:19:58,,,,,,,,

Eighty cravings were examined, of which approximately one half developed into binges. RESULTS: At the bivariate level, binge eating resulted from cravings more often if the women were alone, in the morning, and following eating the craved food. These factors interacted, so that binges were more likely if the women avoided a craved food in the morning, but not later in the day.

The present study aimed first to determine whether corticolimbic structures participate in the expression of FAA, therefore c-Fos immunoreactivity (Fos-IR) was employed as marker of neuronal activity. The second goal was to characterize diurnal rhythms of the clock protein protein Per1 (PER1) in corticolimbic structures and to determine the influence of RFS on the diurnal temporal pattern. Rats were maintained under RFS with food access for 2 h daily, a control group was fed ad libitum. Food entrainment produced a pattern of increased Fos-IR during FAA and after mealtime in the two sub-regions of the nucleus accumbens (ACC), in the basolateral and central amygdala, in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), in the lateral septum (LS), in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT). No increased Fos-IR was observed in the hippocampus. Under ad libitum conditions all structures studied showed daily oscillations of PER1, excluding both amygdalar nuclei and the PFC. RFS shifted and set the daily peaks at zeitgeber time (ZT) 12 for both sub-regions in the accumbens, the hippocampus, lateral septum and PFC. RFS enhanced the amplitude at ZT12 of the BNST and shifted the peak of the PVT to ZT6. No changes were observed in the amygdalar nuclei. Present data indicate that cellular activation of corticolimbic structures is associated with behavioral events related to food anticipatory activity and that mealtime is a relevant signal that shifts daily oscillations of PER1 in corticolimbic structures.

This paper describes a series of experiments developed to examine the response of hypothalamic neuropeptides to diets rich in sugar and fat, using three different diets: a high-fat high-sugar (HFHS) choice diet with access to chow, saturated fat and a 30% sugar solution; a high-fat (HF) choice diet with access to chow and saturated fat; or to a high-sugar (HS) choice diet with access to chow and a sugar solution. METHOD: We first studied caloric intake, body weight gain, hormonal alterations and hypothalamic neuropeptide expression when male Wistar rats were subjected to an HFHS choice, an HF choice or an HS choice diet for 1 week. Next, we studied caloric intake and body weight gain when rats were subjected to the choice diets for 5 weeks. Finally, we measured neuropeptide expression in hepatic vagotomized rats subjected to an HFHS choice, an HF choice or an HS choice diet for 1 week. RESULTS: In rats on an HF choice diet, plasma leptin concentrations and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA increased and neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA decreased. Rats on an HFHS choice diet showed identical plasma leptin concentrations as rats on an HF choice diet. However, NPY mRNA increased and POMC mRNA decreased. An HS choice diet for 1 week did not alter hypothalamic neuropeptide expression or plasma leptin concentrations. As hormonal changes did not explain the differences in hypothalamic neuropeptide expression between rats on the choice diets, we addressed whether neuronal feedback signals mediated the hypothalamic neuropeptide response. The POMC mRNA response to different diets depended on an intact innervation of liver and upper intestinal tract. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the specific combination of saturated fat and a 30% sugar solution results in hyperphagia-induced obesity and alters hypothalamic neuropeptide expression, and that the response of the melanocortin system is mediated by the hepatic vagus.","A free-choice high-fat high-sugar diet induces changes in arcuate neuropeptide expression that support hyperphagia.","International journal of obesity (2005)","la Fleur SE and van Rozen AJ and Luijendijk MC and Groeneweg F and Adan RA","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 14:10:36,-1,2021-03-29 19:23:40,,,,,,,,

Although a number of animal models have been developed to investigate vulnerability to stimulant addiction, few have considered how vulnerability traits such as impulsivity predict hallmark features of heroin addiction including the escalation of drug intake and increased propensity for relapse following protracted abstinence. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether high impulsivity in rats predicts the propensity to escalate intravenous heroin self-administration and to relapse following an extended withdrawal period from heroin. METHODS: High (HI)- and low (LI)-impulsive rats, defined by the extent of premature responding on the 5-choice serial reaction time test (5-CSRTT), were catheterized and allowed to self-administer heroin (40 mug/100 mul/infusion). After 5 days of short access (1 h/day) to heroin, rats were then given extended (6 h/day) access to heroin for 18 consecutive days. RESULTS: High impulsivity predicted neither a greater tendency to acquire heroin SA nor an increased escalation of heroin self-administration. Moreover, high impulsivity was not associated with an increased propensity to relapse after protracted withdrawal from heroin. Nevertheless, marked inter-individual differences in the escalation of heroin self-administration were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Although high impulsivity on the 5-CSRTT has been shown to predict loss of control over cocaine intake, this does not generalize to a loss of control over heroin self-administration. These findings suggest important distinctions in vulnerability mechanisms underlying cocaine and heroin addiction with trait-like impulsivity playing a role in stimulant but not opiate addiction.","Trait-like impulsivity does not predict escalation of heroin self-administration in the rat.","Psychopharmacology","McNamara R and Dalley JW and Robbins TW and Everitt BJ and Belin D","Drug-related intermittent or continuous access",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:07:53,-1,2021-04-07 18:08:21,,,,,,,,

Increased central activity of the CRF network stimulates all monoaminergic cell groups, as well as premotor autonomic and other limbic structures resulting in the typical arousal, behavioral changes, autonomic, and neuroendocrine changes that accompany the chronic imposition of a stressor. By contrast, elevated GCs appear, through a variety of means to counteract the effects of central CRF, which they have initiated. Together with insulin, the GCs stimulate drive for and ingestion of 'comfort foods' that may directly result in reduction of the negative effects of the chronic stressor in the nucleus Accumbens, through stimulation of the anterior, more pleasure-associated part of this cell group, thus reducing the weight of the stress-stimulated posterior, more defensive part. Furthermore, the shift in caloric intake from chow to preference for 'comfort foods,' together with elevated GCs and insulin, reorganize energy stores from a peripheral to a central distribution, primarily as abdominal fat.

Because palatable food stimulates neural systems that are implicated in drug addiction, it was hypothesized that intermittent, excessive sugar intake might create dependency, as indicated by withdrawal signs. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Male rats were food-deprived for 12 hours daily, including 4 hours in the early dark, and then offered highly palatable 25% glucose in addition to chow for the next 12 hours. Withdrawal was induced by naloxone or food deprivation. Withdrawal signs were measured by observation, ultrasonic recordings, elevated plus maze tests, and in vivo microdialysis. RESULTS: Naloxone (20 mg/kg intraperitoneally) caused somatic signs, such as teeth chattering, forepaw tremor, and head shakes. Food deprivation for 24 hours caused spontaneous withdrawal signs, such as teeth chattering. Naloxone (3 mg/kg subcutaneously) caused reduced time on the exposed arm of an elevated plus maze, where again significant teeth chattering was recorded. The plus maze anxiety effect was replicated with four control groups for comparison. Accumbens microdialysis revealed that naloxone (10 and 20 mg/kg intraperitoneally) decreased extracellular dopamine (DA), while dose-dependently increasing acetylcholine (ACh). The naloxone-induced DA/ACh imbalance was replicated with 10% sucrose and 3 mg/kg naloxone subcutaneously. DISCUSSION: Repeated, excessive intake of sugar created a state in which an opioid antagonist caused behavioral and neurochemical signs of opioid withdrawal. The indices of anxiety and DA/ACh imbalance were qualitatively similar to withdrawal from morphine or nicotine, suggesting that the rats had become sugar-dependent.","Evidence that intermittent, excessive sugar intake causes endogenous opioid dependence.","Obesity research","Colantuoni C and Rada P and McCarthy J and Patten C and Avena NM and Chadeayne A and Hoebel BG","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc)",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 18:18:02,-1,2021-04-06 18:43:42,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: To introduce the Salted Food Addition Hypothesis. This theory proposes that salted food acts in the brain like an opiate agonist, producing a hedonic reward which has been perceived as being only peripherally 'flavorful', 'tasty' or 'delicious'. The Salted Food Addition Hypothesis also proposes that opiate receptor withdrawal has been perceived as 'preference,' 'urges,' 'craving' or 'hunger' for salted food. METHODS: The Salted Food Addiction Hypothesis is made manifest by individually presenting a basic review of its primary coexisting components; the Neurological Component and the Psychosocial Component. We also designed a prospective study in order to test our hypothesis that opiate dependent subjects increase their consumption of salted food during opiate withdrawal. RESULTS: The neuropsychiatric evidence integrated here suggests that salted food acts like an, albeit mild, opiate agonist which drives overeating and weight gain. The opiate dependent group studied (N=27) developed a 6.6% increase in weight during opiate withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: Salted Food may be an addictive substance that stimulates opiate and dopamine receptors in the brain's reward and pleasure center more than it is 'tasty', while salted food preference, urge, craving and hunger may be manifestations of opiate withdrawal.

METHOD: A performance based test (Matching Familiar Figure Test, MFFT), a child interview and questionnaire, and parental reports were obtained from 56 overweight children and 53 normal weight children aged 10-18 years. RESULTS: Overweight children responded in a more impulsive way on the MFFT (P < .01). On the child questionnaire, overweight boys reported more problems with focussing attention (P < .05) and both overweight boys and girls reported being worse at shifting their attention compared with normal weight children (P < .05). In particular, overweight boys showed more impulsivity (P < .05), hyperactivity (P < .01), and inattention symptoms (P < .001) as measured via the clinical interview. Parents of overweight children reported an equal amount of impulsivity and hyperactivity symptoms as parents of normal weight children, but scored their children lower on the Conscientiousness personality dimension (P < .01). CONCLUSION: A subgroup of overweight children appears to have a stronger tendency to act on impulse than normal weight children, and demonstrated an impulsivity prone personality.

We examined whether the serotonin innervation or relation to catecholamine (mainly dopamine) axons in the nucleus accumbens shows common features or specializations corresponding to the noted functional differences in core and shell subregions. To address this question, we examined the ultrastructure of serotonin-containing axons and their relation to catecholamine-containing afferents in either the core or shell of the nucleus accumbens. Single coronal sections through the rat forebrain were processed for immunoperoxidase labeling of serotonin and immunogold silver labeling of tyrosine hydroxylase, the catecholamine-synthesizing enzyme. Varicose processes showing peroxidase product for serotonin by light microscopy were confirmed to be axons and terminals by electron microscopy. In a quantitative analysis of serotonin-immunoreactive terminals forming one or more contacts in single sections, some common features were observed. For the core (n = 120) and the shell (n = 82), 41% formed synaptic junctions with unlabeled dendrites, 75% were in apposition with unlabeled terminals, which often formed asymmetric junctions, and 20% were in apposition with axons or terminals containing tyrosine hydroxylase. Thus, in both the core and shell of the nucleus accumbens, serotonin terminals synapse on postsynaptic neurons and are likely to modulate or be modulated by presynaptic interactions with excitatory axons forming asymmetric junctions and by catecholaminergic afferents. Marked differences in the morphology of serotonin axons were also seen in the core versus shell of the nucleus accumbens. By light microscopy, serotonin-immunoreactive axons were thicker and more varicose than those found in the core. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed that, in contrast to the core, serotonin-immunoreactive axons and terminals in the shell were larger in cross-sectional diameter size (0.7 micron vs. 0.3 micron). Additionally, serotonin axon terminals in the shell contained more numerous immunoreactive large dense core vesicles and more frequently formed symmetric as opposed to asymmetric contacts with dendrites. The larger size and more numerous dense core vesicles in serotonin-immunoreactive terminals in the shell support the concept that serotonin or co-existing neurotransmitter may be more tonically released in the shell versus core of the nucleus accumbens.","Ultrastructure of serotonin-immunoreactive terminals in the core and shell of the rat nucleus accumbens: cellular substrates for interactions with catecholamine afferents.","The Journal of comparative neurology","Van Bockstaele EJ and Pickel VM","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:11:20,-1,2021-04-07 19:27:52,,,,,,,,

Highly palatable foods activate these same brain areas, specifically the nucleus accumbens. In this study, the effects of a highly palatable food (sucrose) on these circuits were investigated using the dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptor agonist quinpirole. Male Long-Evans rats received 30 min daily access to 0.3 M sucrose solution or water over nine consecutive days, followed by nine daily injections of quinpirole (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) or saline. Locomotor activity was assessed using an automated open-field system. Locomotor sensitization developed, as quinpirole-treated rats traveled significantly more, and exhibited a greater number of movements than saline controls. A characteristic pattern of an initial suppression of locomotor activity, followed by excitation of activity was observed in quinpirole-treated rats. Pre-exposure to sucrose attenuated the initial suppression of activity, and facilitated excitation of activity. Rats that were pre-exposed to sucrose exhibited a reduced suppression of activity as compared to rats pre-exposed to water. Rats receiving sucrose and quinpirole also displayed a significantly greater enhancement of locomotor activity as compared to rats receiving water and quinpirole. These results support the hypothesis that highly palatable foods can alter the same neural reward circuits as drugs of abuse, and may facilitate sensitization-related addiction. This may aid in further understanding the neural basis of eating disorders.","Quinpirole-induced behavioral sensitization is enhanced by prior scheduled exposure to sucrose: A multi-variable examination of locomotor activity.","Behavioural brain research","Foley KA and Fudge MA and Kavaliers M and Ossenkopp KP","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc)",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 01:57:13,-1,2021-04-06 18:47:08,,,,,,,,

Behavioral and neurobiological analysis of this construct, with evidence from both animal and human studies, defines several dissociable forms depending on distinct cortico-striatal substrates. One form of impulsivity depends on the temporal discounting of reward, another on motor or response disinhibition. Impulsivity is commonly associated with addiction to drugs from different pharmacological classes, but its causal role in human addiction is unclear. We characterize in neurobehavioral and neurochemical terms a rodent model of impulsivity based on premature responding in an attentional task. Evidence is surveyed that high impulsivity on this task precedes the escalation subsequently of cocaine self-administration behavior, and also a tendency toward compulsive cocaine-seeking and to relapse.

However, these studies have lacked well matched sensorimotor control conditions, making it difficult to know what sensory, cognitive, or motor features contributed to changes in dopaminergic activity. Here we report on [11C]raclopride PET studies in which healthy humans performed card selection tasks for monetary rewards. During separate scans, subjects completed a variable ratio (VR) reward schedule with a 25% reward rate in which they did not know the outcome of their responses in advance, a fixed ratio (FR) 25% reward schedule in which outcomes were fully predictable, and a sensorimotor control (SC) condition involving similar sensory and motor demands but no rewards. Relative to the SC condition, the FR schedule produced only modest increases in dopamine transmission and no decreases relative to the SC condition. In contrast, the VR schedule produced significant increases in dopamine transmission in the left medial caudate nucleus while simultaneously producing significant decreases in other areas of the caudate and putamen. These data indicate: (1) the feasibility of measuring alterations in dopamine transmission even after controlling for sensorimotor features and (2) the complex and regionally specific influence of VR schedules on dopamine transmission.

Animal models of gambling behavior could make a significant contribution to improving our understanding of the neural and neurochemical basis of gambling, and the treatment of PG. When gambling, failing to win critically results in the loss of resources wagered as well as the absence of additional gain. Here, we have incorporated these concepts into a novel rat gambling task (rGT), based, in part, on the 'Iowa' gambling task (IGT) commonly used clinically to measure gambling-like behavior. Rats choose among four different options to earn as many sugar pellets as possible within 30 min. Each option is associated with the delivery of a different amount of reward, but also with a different probability and duration of punishing time-out periods during which reward cannot be earned. The schedules are designed such that persistent choice of options linked with larger rewards result in fewer pellets earned per unit time. Rats learn to avoid these risky options to maximize their earnings, comparable with the optimal strategy in the IGT. Both d-amphetamine and the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, impaired task performance. In contrast, the dopamine D(2) receptor antagonist, eticlopride, improved performance, whereas the D(1) receptor antagonist, SCH23390, had no effect. These data suggest that both serotonergic and dopaminergic agents can impair and improve gambling performance, and indicate that the rGT will be a useful tool to study the biological basis of gambling.","Serotonergic and dopaminergic modulation of gambling behavior as assessed using a novel rat gambling task.","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Zeeb FD and Robbins TW and Winstanley CA","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:17:13,-1,2021-04-07 18:47:25,,,,,,,,

Virtually all drugs of abuse, including heroin and other opiates, alcohol, cocaine, amphetamine and nicotine activate dopaminergic systems. So called 'natural' rewards such as food, positive social interactions and even humor, likewise activate DA neurons and are powerful aids to attention and learning. Sweet solutions are a well-characterized natural reward. When a source of sugar is encountered, animals will consume substantial amounts, return to it preferentially, and will work to obtain access. Dopamine systems are activated in animals drinking sugar solutions, and lesions of dopaminergic neurons or pharmacological blockade of DA receptors seem to reduce the reward value of both sweet tastes and drugs of abuse. However, we have recently demonstrated that genetically modified mice that cannot make DA (DD mice) manifest normal sucrose preference. During preference tests, mutant mice initiated licking less frequently than did normal mice, but the rate of licking by DD mice for sweets was actually higher than that of normal mice, indicating that their motor ability to lick is intact. We conclude that DA is not required for the hedonic response to sweets nor for their discrimination.

In support of this, we report here that striatal regions of sugar-dependent rats show alterations in dopamine and opioid mRNA levels similar to morphine-dependent rats. Specifically, after a chronic schedule of intermittent bingeing on a sucrose solution, mRNA levels for the D2 dopamine receptor, and the preproenkephalin and preprotachykinin genes were decreased in dopamine-receptive regions of the forebrain, while D3 dopamine receptor mRNA was increased. While morphine affects gene expression across the entire dopamine-receptive striatum, significant differences were detected in the effects of sugar on the nucleus accumbens and adjacent caudate-putamen. The effects of sugar on mRNA levels were of greater magnitude in the nucleus accumbens than in the caudate-putamen. These areas also showed clear differences in the interactions among the genes, especially between D3R and the other genes. This was revealed by a novel multivariate analysis method that identified cooperative interactions among genes, specifically in the nucleus accumbens but not the caudate-putamen. Finally, a role for these cooperative interactions in a load-sharing response to perturbations caused by sugar was supported by the finding of a different pattern of correlations between the genes in the two striatal regions. These findings support a major role for the nucleus accumbens in mediating the effects of naturally rewarding substances and extend an animal model for studying the common substrates of drug addiction and eating disorders.","Opiate-like effects of sugar on gene expression in reward areas of the rat brain.","Brain research.

We show that stimulation of D1-like dopamine receptors in the nucleus accumbens shell reinstates cocaine seeking by activating L-type Ca(2+) channels and CaMKII. Cocaine reinstatement is associated with D1-like dopamine receptor-dependent increases in accumbens shell CaMKII phosphorylated on Thr286 and glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1) phosphorylated on Ser831 (a known CaMKII phosphorylation site), in addition to increases in cell-surface expression of GluR1-containing AMPA receptors in the shell. Consistent with these findings, cocaine reinstatement is attenuated by intra-shell administration of AAV10-GluR1-C99, a vector that impairs the transport of GluR1-containing AMPA receptors.

Given that the response to novelty is the basis of the definition of sensation-seeking, individual differences in reactivity to novelty have been studied on behavioral and biological levels. Certain individuals labeled as high responders (HR) as opposed to low responders (LR) have been shown to be highly reactive when exposed to a novel environment. These groups were investigated for free-choice responses to novel environments differing in complexity and aversiveness, and to other kinds of reinforcement, i.e. food and a drug. The HR rats appeared to seek novelty, variety and emotional stimulation. Only HR individuals have been found to be predisposed to drug-taking: they develop amphetamine self-administration whereas LR individuals do not. They also exhibit a higher sensitivity to the reinforcing properties of food. On a biological level, compared to LR rats, HR animals have an enhanced level of dopaminergic activity in the nucleus accumbens both under basal conditions or following a tail-pinch stress. HR and LR rats differ in reactivity of the corticotropic axis: HR rats exposed to a novel environment have a prolonged secretion of corticosterone compared to LR rats. The association of novelty, drug and food seeking in the same individual suggests that these characteristics share common processes. Differences in dopaminergic activity between HR and LR rats are consistent with results implicating these dopaminergic neurons in response to novelty and in drug-taking behavior. Given that rats self-administer corticosterone and that HR rats are more sensitive to the reinforcing properties of corticosteroids, it could be speculated that HR rats seek novelty for the reinforcing action of corticosterone. These characteristics may be analogous to some for the features found in human high-sensation seekers and this animal model may be useful in determinating the biological basis of this human trait.","Novelty-seeking in rats--biobehavioral characteristics and possible relationship with the sensation-seeking trait in man.","Neuropsychobiology","Dellu F and Piazza PV and Mayo W and Le Moal M and Simon H","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:13:51,-1,2021-04-07 18:45:28,,,,,,,,

However, it is not fully clear whether impulsivity is a pre-existing trait or a consequence of drug abuse. Recent observations in the animal models show that pre-existing levels of impulsivity predict cocaine and nicotine seeking. Whether such relationships also exist with respect to non-stimulant drugs is largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: We studied the relationship between impulsive choice and vulnerability to heroin taking and seeking. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were selected in the delayed reward task based on individual differences in impulsive choice. Subsequently, heroin intravenous self-administration behaviour was analysed, including acquisition of heroin intake, motivation, extinction and drug- and cue-induced reinstatement. Throughout the entire experiment, changes in impulsive choice were monitored weekly. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: High impulsivity did not predict measures of heroin taking. Moreover, high impulsive rats did not differ from low impulsive rats in extinction rates or heroin- and cue-induced reinstatement. However, both groups became more impulsive as heroin self-administration continued. During abstinence, impulsivity levels returned towards baseline (pre-heroin) levels. Our results indicate that, in contrast to psychostimulants, impulsive choice does not predict vulnerability to heroin seeking and taking. CONCLUSION: These data implicate that different neural mechanisms may underlie the vulnerability to opiate and psychostimulant dependence. Moreover, our data suggest that elevated impulsivity levels as observed in heroin-dependent subjects are a consequence of heroin intake rather than a pre-existing vulnerability trait.","Unidirectional relationship between heroin self-administration and impulsive decision-making in rats.","Psychopharmacology","Schippers MC and Binnekade R and Schoffelmeer AN and Pattij T and De Vries TJ","Drug-related intermittent or continuous access",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:28:00,-1,2021-04-09 15:52:57,,,,,,,,

However, some people do take advantage of treatments and are able to retain their weight loss. What makes the difference between those who can keep their weight loss and those who cannot? One possible predictor of relapse in obesity treatment is impulsivity. Overall, obese people are found to be more impulsive than lean people, especially obese binge eaters. Intuitively, it would make sense that the most impulsive people are less able to keep control over eating behaviour. Therefore, impulsivity could serve as an obstacle for treatment. In the present study impulsivity was measured with a behavioural task (the stop signal task) in 26 obese children. Overweight of the children was measured before and after treatment and at 6 and 12 months follow ups. The results show that impulsivity was related to overweight at all moments: The most impulsive children were the most overweight ones; even after 12 months. Moreover, impulsivity predicted therapy success: the most impulsive children lost less weight. Impulsivity appears to contribute to the difference between succeeding or failing in attempts to lose weight.","Impulsivity predicts treatment outcome in obese children.","Behaviour research and therapy","Nederkoorn C and Jansen E and Mulkens S and Jansen A","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:09:50,-1,2021-04-07 19:27:13,,,,,,,,

Current views distinguish two forms of uncertainty, namely risk and ambiguity, depending on whether the probability distributions of outcomes are known or unknown. Behavioural neurophysiological studies on dopamine neurons revealed a risk signal, which covaried with the standard deviation or variance of the magnitude of juice rewards and occurred separately from reward value coding. Human imaging studies identified similarly distinct risk signals for monetary rewards in the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), thus fulfilling a requirement for the mean variance approach of economic decision theory. The orbitofrontal risk signal covaried with individual risk attitudes, possibly explaining individual differences in risk perception and risky decision making. Ambiguous gambles with incomplete probabilistic information induced stronger brain signals than risky gambles in OFC and amygdala, suggesting that the brain's reward system signals the partial lack of information. The brain can use the uncertainty signals to assess the uncertainty of rewards, influence learning, modulate the value of uncertain rewards and make appropriate behavioural choices between only partly known options.","Explicit neural signals reflecting reward uncertainty.","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

METHODS: A meta-analytic strategy was employed to synthesize estimates from 119 prevalence studies. This method produced more reliable prevalence rates than were available from any single study. RESULTS: Prevalence estimates among samples of adolescents were significantly higher than estimates among samples of adults for both clinical (level 3) and subclinical (level 2) measures of disordered gambling within both lifetime and past-year time frames (e.g., 3.9% vs 1.6% for lifetime estimates of level 3 gambling). Among adults, prevalence estimates of disordered gambling have increased significantly during the past 20 years. CONCLUSIONS: Membership in youth, treatment, or prison population segments is significantly associated with experiencing gambling-related disorders. Understanding subclinical gamblers provides a meaningful opportunity to lower the public health burden associated with gambling disorders.

These behavioural effects of glucocorticoids involve an action on the meso-accumbens dopamine system, one of the major systems mediating the addictive properties of drugs of abuse. The effects of glucocorticoids in the nucleus accumbens are site-specific; these hormones modify dopamine transmission in only the shell of this nucleus without modifying it in the core. Studies with corticosteroid receptor antagonists suggest that the dopaminergic effects of these hormones depend mostly on glucocorticoid, not on mineralocorticoid receptors. These data suggest that an increase in glucocorticoid hormones, through an action on mesolimbic dopamine neurons, could increase vulnerability to drug abuse. We also discuss the implications of this finding with respect to the physiological role of glucocorticoids. It is proposed that an increase in glucocorticoids, by activating the reward pathway, could counteract the aversive effects of stress. During chronic stress, repeated increases in glucocorticoids and dopamine would result in sensitization of the reward system. This sensitized state, which can persist after the end of the stress, would render the subject more responsive to drugs of abuse and consequently more vulnerable to the development of addiction.","Interaction between glucocorticoid hormones, stress and psychostimulant drugs.","The European journal of neuroscience","Marinelli M and Piazza PV","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:28:32,-1,2021-04-09 15:53:14,,,,,,,,

As such, addiction can be viewed as increased control of behavior by the desired drug (due to its unconditioned, rewarding properties). It is also clear that drug-associated (conditioned) stimuli acquire heightened abilities to control behaviors. These phenomena have been linked with dopamine function within the ventral striatum and amygdala and have been described specifically in terms of motivational and incentive learning processes. New data are emerging that suggest that regions of the frontal cortex involved in inhibitory response control are directly affected by long-term exposure to drugs of abuse. The result of chronic drug use may be frontal cortical cognitive dysfunction, resulting in an inability to inhibit inappropriate unconditioned or conditioned responses elicited by drugs, by related stimuli or by internal drive states. Drug-seeking behavior may thus be due to two related phenomena: (1) augmented incentive motivational qualities of the drug and associated stimuli (due to limbic/amygdalar dysfunction) and (2) impaired inhibitory control (due to frontal cortical dysfunction). In this review, we consider the neuro-anatomical and neurochemical substrates subserving inhibitory control and motivational processes in the rodent and primate brain and their putative impact on drug seeking. The evidence for cognitive impulsivity in drug abuse associated with dysfunction of the frontostriatal system will be discussed, and an integrative hypothesis for compulsive reward-seeking in drug abuse will be presented.","Impulsivity resulting from frontostriatal dysfunction in drug abuse: implications for the control of behavior by reward-related stimuli.","Psychopharmacology","Jentsch JD and Taylor JR","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:10:31,-1,2021-04-07 18:40:00,,,,,,,,

We investigated the effects of MDD on the outcome of substance dependence under 3 circumstances: (1) lifetime onset of MDD prior to lifetime onset of dependence onset, (2) current MDD occurring during a period of abstinence, and (3) current MDD during substance use that exceeded the expected effects of intoxication or withdrawal. METHODS: A sample of 250 inpatients with DSM-IV cocaine, heroin, and/or alcohol dependence were followed up at 6, 12, and 18 months. The Psychiatric Research Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders (PRISM) was used to make DSM-IV diagnoses. Using Cox proportional hazards models, stable remissions (those lasting at least 26 weeks) from DSM-IV cocaine, heroin, and/or alcohol dependence and from use were studied, as well as subsequent relapses of dependence and use. RESULTS: Patients with current substance-induced MDD were less likely to remit from dependence (adjusted hazards ratio, 0.11) than patients with no baseline MDD. A history of MDD prior to lifetime onset of substance dependence also reduced the likelihood of remission relative to the absence of such a history (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.49). Major depressive disorder during sustained abstinence predicted dependence relapse (adjusted hazards ratio, 3.07) and substance use after hospital discharge compared with those without abstinence MDD (adjusted hazards ratio, 1.45).

However, the precise physiological relevance of this signaling pathway in mediating dopamine behaviors is still unclear. Here we report that stimulation of dopamine receptor signaling in vivo with systemic administration of apomorphine, amphetamine, and cocaine leads to increased production of inositol triphosphate (IP3) in the mouse striatum. Using selective antagonists and dopamine D1 and D2 receptor knock-out animals, we show that the production of IP3 is mediated by the D1 receptor, but not the D2 receptor. A selective blocker of PLCbeta, U73122, was used to assess the physiological relevance of D1-mediated IP3 production. We show that U73122 inhibits the locomotor-stimulating effects of apomorphine, amphetamine, cocaine, and SKF81297. Furthermore, U73122 also suppresses the spontaneous hyperactivity exhibited by dopamine transporter knock-out mice. Importantly, the effects of U73122 are selective to dopamine-mediated hyperactivity, as this compound does not affect hyperactivity induced by the glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist MK801. Finally, we present evidence showing that an imbalance of D1- and D2-mediated signaling following U73122 treatment modifies the locomotor output of animals from horizontal locomotor activity to vertical activity, further highlighting the importance of the PLCbeta pathway in the regulation of forward locomotion via dopamine receptors.","D1 dopamine receptor coupling to PLCbeta regulates forward locomotion in mice.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Medvedev IO and Ramsey AJ and Masoud ST and Bermejo MK and Urs N and Sotnikova TD and Beaulieu JM and Gainetdinov RR and Salahpour A","Drug-related intermittent or continuous access",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 15:20:31,-1,2021-04-11 19:28:55,,,,,,,,

As hypothesized, the near miss had a statistically significant effect on the number of trials in extinction. An inverted U-shaped effect of the near miss showed that the 30% near miss condition led to the greatest persistence, as compared to 45% and 15% near miss conditions. There was no statistically significant effect of the big win. Both cognitive and behavioral theories are discussed as explanations for effects of the near miss.","Effects of the 'near miss' and the 'big win' on persistence at slot machine gambling.","Psychology of addictive behaviors : journal of the Society of Psychologists in Addictive Behaviors","Kassinove JI and Schare ML","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 02:24:28,-1,2021-04-06 19:26:57,,,,,,,,

Thus, CSs can have both predictive and incentive properties. We ask here whether it is possible to dissociate the predictive versus incentive properties of a CS in rats by considering individual differences in the nature of the CR. METHODS: We used Pavlovian procedures to study the ability of a localizable CS (an illuminated lever) to acquire two properties of an incentive stimulus-the ability to attract and the ability to act as a conditional reinforcer. RESULTS: For some rats, the CS evoked a 'sign-tracking' CR, consisting of approach toward and engagement with the CS itself. For other rats, the CS instead produced a 'goal-tracking' CR: approach was directed away from the CS toward the site of food delivery. For sign-trackers (but not goal-trackers) the CS also acted as an effective conditional reinforcer. CONCLUSIONS: The predictive and incentive properties of a CS can be dissociated by considering individual differences in the CR. In a given animal, a cue that is predictive of reward, supporting Pavlovian learning, may or may not be attributed with incentive salience. This procedure may provide a powerful means to test hypotheses regarding the role of neural systems in learning versus incentive motivational functions and to study individual variation in the extent to which reward-associated stimuli act as incentive stimuli.","Dissociating the predictive and incentive motivational properties of reward-related cues through the study of individual differences.","Biological psychiatry","Robinson TE and Flagel SB","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:08:14,-1,2021-04-07 18:11:07,,,,,,,,

Our previous studies have confirmed the adaptogenic and antistress properties of a single administration of R. rosea L. extract in rats exposed to acute stress. There is increasing evidence that prolonged exposure to stressful life events and depression are both related to significant behavioural, endocrinological and neurobiological changes in human and animal subjects. The aim of this study was to determine whether chronic treatment with a hydroalcoholic R. rosea extract (RHO) standardized in 3% rosavin and 1% salidroside can prevent alterations induced in female rats following 6 weeks of a chronic mild stress (CMS) procedure. This was analysed through the behavioural and physiological parameters of consumption of 1% sucrose solution, locomotor and exploratory activities, body weight gain and oestrous cycle length. After the first 3 weeks of stress, RHO was administered daily by gavage at doses of 10, 15 and 20 mg/kg for the remaining 3 weeks. In addition, the antidepressant drug fluoxetine (10 mg/kg os), which has been shown to reverse CMS-induced disruptions, was used as the reference treatment. Rats subjected to the CMS procedure demonstrated decreased sucrose intake, reduced moving behaviour, minimized weight gain and dysregulation of their oestrous cycle. Treatment with RHO completely reverted all of these changes. The effects of RHO were comparable to those of fluoxetine. Interestingly, neither RHO nor fluoxetine influence the behavioural and physiological parameters tested in non-stressed animals. These findings strongly showed that chronic administration of RHO results in potent inhibition of the behavioural and physiological changes induced by chronic exposure to mild stressors.","Effects of Rhodiola rosea L. extract on behavioural and physiological alterations induced by chronic mild stress in female rats.","Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)","Mattioli L and Funari C and Perfumi M","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:10:50,-1,2021-04-07 18:40:11,,,,,,,,

Since glucocorticoids have euphoric effects in some individuals and have been shown to potentiate the reinforcing properties of drugs of abuse in animals, we hypothesized that corticosterone secretion during stress-like situations may have reinforcing effects and that a higher sensitivity to the reinforcing effects of glucocorticoids might be a biological basis of sensation seeking. In this report we show that (i) corticosterone has reinforcing properties, as evidenced by the development of intravenous self-administration, (ii) self-administration of corticosterone is observed at plasma levels that are comparable to those induced by stress, and (iii) there are individual differences in corticosterone self-administration, which are related to individual reactivity to novelty and sensitivity to drugs of abuse, behavioral features akin to certain traits of high-sensation seekers.

However, it is not clear which food categories are responsible for this increase. Food availability data, which are calculated from annual food production, imports, beginning stocks, subtracting exports, ending stocks, and nonfood uses, provide clues about which categories are the primary contributors. Data from 1909 to 2007 show increases in per capita availability of several product classes: added oils increased from 16.1 to 39.4 kg/y, meat increased from 56.3 to 91.2 kg/y, cheese increased from 1.7 to 14.9 kg/y, and frozen dairy products increased from 0.7 to 11.5 kg/y. From 1970 to 2007, per capita availability of sweeteners increased from 54.1 to 62.0 kg/y. Carbonated beverage availability has increased, partly at the expense of fluid milk. Flour and cereal availability decreased from 1909 until the late 1960s but rebounded thereafter. Availability of fruit, fruit juices, and vegetables has increased. We conclude that the major contributors to increased energy intake over the last century are oils, shortening, meat, cheese, and frozen desserts, with more recent increases in added sweeteners, fruit, fruit juices, and vegetables.

METHOD: The subjects were 313 cocaine-dependent (200 also opiate-dependent) outpatients in clinical trials of medication for cocaine dependence. Pathological gambling (DSM-III-R criteria) was assessed with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule, and sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics were determined with the Addiction Severity Index. Outcome was defined as time in treatment (proportion of maximum scheduled time) and proportion of cocaine-positive urine samples during treatment. RESULTS: Pathological gambling had a lifetime occurrence rate of 8.0% and a current (past month) occurrence of 3.8%. Onset preceded the onset of cocaine dependence in 72.0% of the patients (and preceded onset of opiate dependence in 44.4%). Patients with pathological gambling (lifetime or current) did not differ significantly from other patients in length of treatment or proportion of cocaine-positive urine samples. Those with lifetime pathological gambling were significantly more likely to have tobacco dependence (84.0% versus 61.1%) and antisocial personality disorder (56.0% versus 19.8%), to be unemployed (84.0% versus 49.3%), to have recently engaged in illegal activity for profit (64.0% versus 38.5%), and to have been incarcerated (62.5% versus 33.9%).

DESIGN: Binge-eating prone (BEP) and resistant (BER) groups were identified. Differential responses to stress, hunger, macronutrient-varied PFs, a diet-induced obesity (DIO) regimen and daily vs intermittent access to a PF+chow diet, were assessed. SUBJECTS: One hundred and twenty female Sprague-Dawley rats. MEASUREMENTS: Reliability of intake patterns within rats; food intake and body weight after various challenges over acute (1, 2, 4 h), 24-h and 2-week periods. RESULTS: Although BEP and BER rats did not differ in amount of chow consumed, BEPs consumed >50% more intermittent PF than BERs (P<0.001) and consistently so (alpha=0.86). BEPs suppressed chow but not PF intake when stressed, and ate as much when sated as when hungry. Conversely, BERs were more affected by stress and ate less PF, not chow, when stressed and were normally hyperphagic to energy deficit. BEP overeating generalized to other PFs varying in sucrose, fat and nutrition content. Half the rats in each group proved to be obesity prone after a no-choice high fat diet (DIO diet) but a continuous diet of PF+chow normalized the BEPs high drive for PF. CONCLUSION: Greater intermittent intake of PF predicts binge-eating independent of susceptibility to weight gain. Daily fat consumption in a nutritious source (DIO-diet; analogous to a fatty meal) promoted overeating and weight gain but limiting fat to daily non-nutritive food (PF+chow; analogous to a snack with a low fat meal), did not.

Evidence for sugar addiction: Behavioral and neurochemical effects of intermittent, excessive sugar intake. Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews XX(X), XXX-XXX]. The experimental question is whether or not sugar can be a substance of abuse and lead to a natural form of addiction. 'Food addiction' seems plausible because brain pathways that evolved to respond to natural rewards are also activated by addictive drugs. Sugar is noteworthy as a substance that releases opioids and dopamine and thus might be expected to have addictive potential. This review summarizes evidence of sugar dependence in an animal model. Four components of addiction are analyzed. 'Bingeing,' 'withdrawal,' 'craving' and 'cross-sensitization' are each given operational definitions and demonstrated behaviorally with sugar bingeing as the reinforcer. These behaviors are then related to neurochemical changes in the brain that also occur with addictive drugs. Neural adaptations include changes in dopamine and opioid receptor binding, enkephalin mRNA expression and dopamine and acetylcholine release in the nucleus accumbens. The evidence supports the hypothesis that under certain circumstances rats can become sugar dependent.

However, reward cues have multiple properties. For example, they not only act as predictors of reward capable of evoking conditional responses (CRs), but they may also acquire incentive motivational properties. As incentive stimuli they can evoke complex emotional and motivational states. Here we sought to determine whether the predictive value of a reward cue is sufficient to engage brain reward systems, or whether the cue must also be attributed with incentive salience. We took advantage of the fact that there are large individual differences in the extent to which reward cues are attributed with incentive salience. When a cue (conditional stimulus, CS) is paired with delivery of food (unconditional stimulus, US), the cue acquires the ability to evoke a CR in all rats; that is, it is equally predictive and supports learning the CS-US association in all. However, only in a subset of rats is the cue attributed with incentive salience, becoming an attractive and desirable incentive stimulus. We used in situ hybridization histochemistry to quantify the ability of a food cue to induce c-fos mRNA expression in rats that varied in the extent to which they attributed incentive salience to the cue. We found that a food cue induced c-fos mRNA in the orbitofrontal cortex, striatum (caudate and nucleus accumbens), thalamus (paraventricular, intermediodorsal and central medial nuclei), and lateral habenula, only in rats that attributed incentive salience to the cue. Furthermore, patterns of 'connectivity' between these brain regions differed markedly between rats that did or did not attribute incentive salience to the food cue.

That is, drugs ultimately are relied on to prevent or relieve negative states that otherwise result from abstinence (e.g., withdrawal) or from adverse environmental circumstances (e.g., stress). Recent work has suggested that this 'dark side' shift also is a key in the development of food addiction. Initially, palatable food consumption has both positively reinforcing, pleasurable effects and negatively reinforcing, 'comforting' effects that can acutely normalize organism responses to stress. Repeated, intermittent intake of palatable food may instead amplify brain stress circuitry and downregulate brain reward pathways such that continued intake becomes obligatory to prevent negative emotional states via negative reinforcement. Stress, anxiety and depressed mood have shown high comorbidity with and the potential to trigger bouts of addiction-like eating behavior in humans. Animal models indicate that repeated, intermittent access to palatable foods can lead to emotional and somatic signs of withdrawal when the food is no longer available, tolerance and dampening of brain reward circuitry, compulsive seeking of palatable food despite potentially aversive consequences, and relapse to palatable food-seeking in response to anxiogenic-like stimuli. The neurocircuitry identified to date in the 'dark' side of food addiction qualitatively resembles that associated with drug and alcohol dependence. The present review summarizes Bart Hoebel's groundbreaking conceptual and empirical contributions to understanding the role of the 'dark side' in food addiction along with related work of those that have followed him.","The dark side of food addiction.","Physiology & behavior","Parylak SL and Koob GF and Zorrilla EP","non-experimental study,non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 14:07:21,-1,2021-03-31 12:31:55,,,,,,,,

Although alpha1AR signaling in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) promotes mesolimbic transmission and drug-induced behaviors, the potential contribution of alpha1ARs in other parts of the pathway, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), has not been investigated before. We found that local blockade of alpha1ARs in the medial NAc shell, but not the VTA, attenuates cocaine- and morphine-induced locomotion. To determine the neuronal substrates that could mediate these effects, we analyzed the cellular, subcellular, and subsynaptic localization of alpha1ARs and characterized the chemical phenotypes of alpha1AR-containing elements within the mesocorticolimbic system using single and double immunocytochemical methods at the electron microscopic (EM) level. We found that alpha1ARs are found mainly extra-synaptically in axons and axon terminals in the NAc and are enriched in glutamatergic and dopaminergic elements. alpha1ARs are also abundant in glutamatergic terminals in the PFC, and in GABA-positive terminals in the VTA. In line with these observations, microdialysis experiments revealed that local blockade of alpha1ARs attenuated the increase in extracellular DA in the medial NAc shell following administration of cocaine. These data indicate that local alpha1ARs control DA transmission in the medial NAc shell and behavioral responses to drugs of abuse.","alpha-1 Adrenergic receptors are localized on presynaptic elements in the nucleus accumbens and regulate mesolimbic dopamine transmission.","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Mitrano DA and Schroeder JP and Smith Y and Cortright JJ and Bubula N and Vezina P and Weinshenker D","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:27:27,-1,2021-04-09 15:52:35,,,,,,,,

The rats were trained to press different levers for these two reinforcers using a sucrose-substitution procedure. An aversion was then conditioned from either the ethanol solution or the food pellets by pairing consumption with illness induced by lithium chloride. When instrumental performance was subsequently tested in extinction, the rats pressed less on the pellet lever if the pellets, rather than the ethanol, had been devalued by aversion conditioning. By contrast, performance on the ethanol lever was unaffected by whether the ethanol or pellets were devalued. Moreover, noncontingent presentations of the devalued reinforcer had no impact on test performance. The differential resistance to outcome devaluation suggests that, in contrast to food seeking, alcohol seeking is a stimulus-response habit rather than a goal-directed action mediated by a representation of the action-outcome contingency.","Alcohol seeking by rats: action or habit?","The Quarterly journal of experimental psychology.

Do they mediate the hedonic impact of rewarding stimuli? Do they mediate hedonic reward learning and associative prediction? Our review of the literature, together with results of a new study of residual reward capacity after dopamine depletion, indicates the answer to both questions is 'no'. Rather, dopamine systems may mediate the incentive salience of rewards, modulating their motivational value in a manner separable from hedonia and reward learning. In a study of the consequences of dopamine loss, rats were depleted of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and neostriatum by up to 99% using 6-hydroxydopamine. In a series of experiments, we applied the 'taste reactivity' measure of affective reactions (gapes, etc.) to assess the capacity of dopamine-depleted rats for: 1) normal affect (hedonic and aversive reactions), 2) modulation of hedonic affect by associative learning (taste aversion conditioning), and 3) hedonic enhancement of affect by non-dopaminergic pharmacological manipulation of palatability (benzodiazepine administration). We found normal hedonic reaction patterns to sucrose vs. quinine, normal learning of new hedonic stimulus values (a change in palatability based on predictive relations), and normal pharmacological hedonic enhancement of palatability. We discuss these results in the context of hypotheses and data concerning the role of dopamine in reward. We review neurochemical, electrophysiological, and other behavioral evidence. We conclude that dopamine systems are not needed either to mediate the hedonic pleasure of reinforcers or to mediate predictive associations involved in hedonic reward learning. We conclude instead that dopamine may be more important to incentive salience attributions to the neural representations of reward-related stimuli. Incentive salience, we suggest, is a distinct component of motivation and reward. In other words, dopamine systems are necessary for 'wanting' incentives, but not for 'liking' them or for learning new 'likes' and 'dislikes'.","What is the role of dopamine in reward: hedonic impact, reward learning, or incentive salience?","Brain research.

The direction of the conditioned response of cod was investigated to elucidate how cod read cue signals. Groups of cod were conditioned to associate a blinking light (conditioned stimulus, CS) with a food reward (unconditioned stimulus, US), with the CS and the US located at opposite sides of the tank. Two groups were trained in a delay conditioning procedure (CS = 60 s, interstimulus interval = 30 s) and two groups were trained in a trace conditioning procedure (CS = 12 s, trace interval = 20 s). The response pattern was similar for the delay- and trace-conditioned groups. The initial main response at the onset of the CS was approaching the blinking lights, i.e. sign-tracking. In the early trials, the fish did not gather in the feeding area before the arrival of food. In the later trials, the fish first approached the blinking lights, but then moved across the tank and gathered below the feeder before the food arrived, i.e. sign-tracking followed by goal-tracking within each trial. These two responses are interpreted as reflecting two learning systems, i.e. one rapid, reflexive response directed at the signal (sign-tracking) and one slower, more flexible response based on expectations about time and place for arrival of the food (goal-tracking).

This review focuses on human and animal data investigating the importance of dopamine on binge eating behaviors. Early work examining dopamine metabolites in the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma of bulimic individuals suggested decreased dopamine turnover during the active phase of the illness. While neuroimaging studies of dopamine mechanisms in bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED) are limited, genetic studies in humans have implicated an increased frequency of dopamine transporter and associated D2 receptor polymorphisms with binge pathology. Recent studies in rodent models of dietary-induced binge eating (DIBE) have investigated plausible dopamine mechanisms involved in sustaining binge eating behaviors. In DIBE models, highly palatable foods (fats, sugars and their combination), as well as restricted access conditions appear to promote ingestive responses and result in sustained dopamine stimulation within the nucleus accumbens. Taken together with studies on the comorbidity of illicit drug use and eating disorders, the data reviewed here support a role for dopamine in perpetuating the compulsive feeding patterns of BN and BED. As such, we propose that sustained stimulation of the dopamine systems by bingeing promoted by preexisting conditions (e.g., genetic traits, dietary restraint, stress, etc.) results in progressive impairments of dopamine signaling. To disrupt this vicious cycle, novel research-based treatment options aiming at the neural substrates of compulsive eating patterns are necessary.","Dopamine and binge eating behaviors.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior","Bello NT and Hajnal A","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 18:17:05,-1,2021-04-06 18:42:30,,,,,,,,

The etiology of binge eating remains perplexing in part because, in humans, it is difficult to isolate and assess the independent and aggregate impact of various contributing variables. Using rats, we found that footshock stress and a history of caloric restriction (S+R), combine synergistically to induce binge eating. Stress and dieting are also strong antecedents and relapse factors in human eating disorders. Here we report further behavioral and physiological parallels to human binge eating. Like the protracted course of human binge eating, young female Sprague-Dawley rats continued to binge eat after 23 restriction/stress cycles (7 months) and this despite experiencing no significant weight loss during the restriction phases. Stress alone reduced adiposity by 35% (p<0.001) but S+R rats had no significant fat loss. An endocrine profile of normal plasma leptin and insulin levels but marked elevation of plasma corticosterone levels was found only in the binge-eating (S+R) rats (p<0.01), also paralleling endocrine profiles reported in clinical binge-eating studies. These behavioral and physiological similarities between this animal model and clinical binge eating increase its utility in understanding binge eating.

Ten-minute tail-pinch was used as a stressor and dopamine release estimated in the nucleus accumbens by using the microdialysis technique. Individual differences were also taken into account by comparing rats identified as either predisposed (HRs) or resistant (LRs) to develop self-administration of drugs of abuse, on the basis of their locomotor response to novelty. It was found that suppression of stress-induced corticosterone secretion significantly decreased stress-induced dopamine release. However, such an effect greatly differed between HR and LR rats. When corticosterone secretion was intact HR animals had a higher and longer dopamine release in response to stress than LRs. The blockade of stress-induced corticosterone secretion selectively reduced the dopaminergic response of HRs that did not differ from LRs anymore. These findings strength the idea that glucocorticoids could be involved in determining propensity to develop drug self-administration.

We developed an animal model of binge eating in sated rats that is evoked by stress, but only in rats with a history of caloric restriction and only if highly palatable food (HPF) is available after stress. This study investigated the effect of known binge triggers, a taste of HPF and of hunger, on this type of binge eating. METHOD: Female rats were cycled through the R/S protocol but this time were given just a taste of HPF with ad lib regular chow. After another R/S cycle, rats were stressed during restriction (while hungry) and were given HPF and chow. RESULTS: Although binge eating did not occur if only chow was available after stress, just a taste of HPF sufficed to increase chow intake to more than 160% (p < 0.001) of rats with a history of restriction only, stress-only, or neither. Hunger increased the proportion of chow consumed by both restricted groups, but stress magnified this hunger-induced overeating by increasing HPF intake to 137% of restriction-only rats (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: These effects suggest that binge eating in this model is motivated by reward, not metabolic need, and parallels observations of binge triggers described in clinical binge-eating disorders. This strengthens the validity of using this animal model to target the physiology and treatment of eating disorders preceded by dieting and stress.","The role of palatable food and hunger as trigger factors in an animal model of stress induced binge eating.","The International journal of eating disorders","Hagan MM and Chandler PC and Wauford PK and Rybak RJ and Oswald KD","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 14:11:40,-1,2021-03-31 12:32:18,,,,,,,,

Female C57Bl6/J mice shipped during the peripubertal/adolescent period (6 wk old) display lower levels of female sexual behavior in response to estradiol and progesterone injections after ovariectomy when tested in adulthood than female mice shipped in adulthood (12 wk old). These shipping-induced reductions in female sexual behavior appear to be limited to a vulnerable period around the time of puberty. Likewise, male mice shipped at 6 wk of age express lower levels of masculine sexual behavior in response to testosterone treatment as adults than do mice shipped when 12 wk old. RIA of corticosterone levels in response to behavior testing revealed that, upon first exposure to testing, mice shipped at 6 wk of age have reduced corticosterone levels. These results suggest that during the peripubertal/adolescent period, mice of both sexes are susceptible to the effects of stressors associated with shipping. Furthermore, they suggest that stress during this period has enduring, negative influences on behavioral responses to estradiol and progesterone in females and to testosterone in males, and it induces changes in response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) are two DA terminal regions that contribute to decision making in distinct manners. However, how fluctuations of tonic DA levels may relate to different aspects of decision making remains to be determined. The present study measured DA efflux in the PFC and NAc with microdialysis in well trained rats performing a probabilistic discounting task. Selection of a small/certain option always delivered one pellet, whereas another, large/risky option yielded four pellets, with probabilities that decreased (100-12.5%) or increased (12.5-100%) across four blocks of trials. Yoked-reward groups were also included to control for reward delivery. PFC DA efflux during decision making decreased or increased over a session, corresponding to changes in large/risky reward probabilities. Similar profiles were observed from yoked-rewarded rats, suggesting that fluctuations in PFC DA reflect changes in the relative rate of reward received. NAc DA efflux also showed decreasing/increasing trends over the session during both tasks. However, DA efflux was higher during decision making on free- versus forced-choice trials and during periods of greater reward uncertainty. Moreover, changes in NAc DA closely tracked shifts in choice biases. These data reveal dynamic and dissociable fluctuations in PFC and NAc DA transmission associated with different aspects of risk-based decision making. PFC DA may signal changes in reward availability that facilitates modification of choice biases, whereas NAc DA encodes integrated signals about reward rates, uncertainty, and choice, reflecting implementation of decision policies.","Dynamic fluctuations in dopamine efflux in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens during risk-based decision making.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","St Onge JR and Ahn S and Phillips AG and Floresco SB","",-1,2021-04-11 19:35:00,1,2021-04-01 20:03:29,-1,2021-04-06 19:28:14,,,,,,,,

Therefore the effects of acute and chronic alcohol (1 gm/kg/day i.p.) treatment on extracellular concentrations of NAc ACh and DA were determined before and after naloxone-precipitated withdrawal.

There was no effect of ethanol on ACh. However, naloxone (3 mg/kg s.c.) injected the next day decreased extracellular DA to 83% of baseline and caused a significant rise in ACh to 119%.

Basal plasma ACTH and IL-6 concentrations were similar in rats from either vendor (HSD or CR), while CR animals exhibited slightly elevated corticosterone levels in late afternoon. Inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1 microgram/kg, i.v.) or turpentine (50 microliter/100 g, i.m.) which induce the production of endogenous cytokines, produced a significantly larger ACTH response in CR, compared to HSD rats, while the overall corticosterone responses were comparable in both rat groups. This could probably not be accounted for by a greater ACTH responsiveness in CR rats per se because CR and HSD rats showed similar peak ACTH responses to electrofootshock. Furthermore, in contrast to when the stimulus was one that induced endogenous cytokine production, the administration of exogenous interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta, 200 ng/kg, i.v.) produced a 2-fold greater rise in plasma ACTH concentrations in HSD rats compared to CR rats. The plasma IL-6 responses to the inflammatory stimuli showed a similar pattern to ACTH, with LPS and turpentine tending to pruduce greater IL-6 responses in CR rats, though these differences were not statistically significant. In contrast HSD rats had a significantly greater IL-6 response to IL-1beta than did CR rats.

The goal of this series of articles is to use a combination of preclinical and clinical data to determine whether foods, like drugs of abuse, can be addictive, the conditions under which the addiction develops, and the underlying neurophysiological substrates. Operational definitions of addiction that have been used in the treatment of human disorders and to guide research in both humans and animals are presented, and an overview of the symposium articles is provided. We propose that specific foods, especially those that are rich in fat and/or sugar, are capable of promoting 'addiction'-like behavior and neuronal change under certain conditions. That is, these foods, although highly palatable, are not addictive per se but become so following a restriction/binge pattern of consumption. Such consummatory patterns have been associated with increased risk for comorbid conditions such as obesity, early weight gain, depression, anxiety, and substance abuse as well as with relapse and treatment challenges. The topic of food addiction bears study, therefore, to develop fresh approaches to clinical intervention and to advance our understanding of basic mechanisms involved in loss of control.","Symposium overview--Food addiction: fact or fiction?","The Journal of nutrition","Corwin RL and Grigson PS","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 14:17:09,-1,2021-03-31 12:33:00,,,,,,,,

METHODS: To address this issue, rats were selected on the basis of individual differences in impulsivity in the delayed reward task (impulsive choice) and the 5-choice serial reaction time task (impulsive action). Subsequently, rats were subjected to a nicotine self-administration (SA) paradigm tailored to measure the motivational properties of nicotine and nicotine-associated stimuli. In separate groups, differences in electrically evoked dopamine release in slice preparations obtained from several mesolimbic brain regions were determined. RESULTS: Impulsive action was associated with an enhanced motivation to initiate and maintain nicotine SA. In contrast, impulsive choice predicted a diminished ability to inhibit nicotine seeking during abstinence and an enhanced vulnerability to relapse upon re-exposure to nicotine cues. Impulsive action was associated with reduced dopamine release in the accumbens core and impulsive choice with reduced dopamine release in accumbens core, shell, and medial prefrontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: The strong association between sub-dimensions of impulsivity and nicotine SA implies that interventions aimed to improve impulse control might help to reduce susceptibility to nicotine dependence and/or lead to successful smoking cessation.","Impulsive choice and impulsive action predict vulnerability to distinct stages of nicotine seeking in rats.","Biological psychiatry","Diergaarde L and Pattij T and Poortvliet I and Hogenboom F and de Vries W and Schoffelmeer AN and De Vries TJ","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 01:58:04,-1,2021-04-06 18:48:41,,,,,,,,

Activations in dopaminoceptive structures correlated with both mathematical parameters. These activations differentiated spatially and temporally. Temporally, the activation related to expected reward was immediate, while the activation related to risk was delayed.

A substantial and significant increase in functional A(2A), but not in functional D(2) receptors, was observed in the nucleus accumbens immediately following 10 days of cocaine self-administration which returned to normal levels after 7 days of drug withdrawal. In contrast, in the posterior dorsal striatum significant reductions in A(2A) expression were observed immediately after cocaine self-administration which was associated with a trend for a reduction of the A(2A) receptor antagonist binding sites. In cocaine withdrawal groups, significant increases in the density and K(d) value of D(2)-like antagonist binding sites were observed in the nucleus accumbens in the absence of changes in D(2) expression, suggesting an up-regulation of D(3) receptors in this region after cocaine withdrawal. A(2A) receptor increases in the nucleus accumbens induced by cocaine may represent a compensatory up-regulation to counteract cocaine-induced increases in D(2) signaling and D(3) signaling which is in line with its disappearance in the 7-day withdrawal group displaying increased reinforcing efficacy of cocaine.

The present experiments explored the contribution of CaMKII in NAcc neurons postsynaptic to these terminals where it is known to participate in a number of signaling pathways that regulate responding to psychostimulant drugs. Exposure to amphetamine transiently increased alphaCaMKII levels in the shell but not the core of the NAcc. Thus, HSV (herpes simplex viral) vectors were used to transiently overexpress alphaCaMKII in NAcc neurons in drug-naive rats, and behavioral responding to amphetamine was assessed. Transiently overexpressing alphaCaMKII in the NAcc shell led to long-lasting enhancement of amphetamine-induced locomotion and self-administration manifested when alphaCaMKII levels were elevated and persisting long after they had returned to baseline. Enhanced locomotion was not observed after infection in the NAcc core or sites adjacent to the NAcc. Transient elevation of NAcc shell alphaCaMKII levels also enhanced locomotor responding to NAcc AMPA and increased phosphorylation levels of GluR1 (Ser831), a CaMKII site, both soon and long after infection. Similar increases in pGluR1 (Ser831) were observed both soon and long after exposure to amphetamine. These results indicate that the transient increase in alphaCaMKII observed in neurons of the NAcc shell after viral-mediated gene transfer and likely exposure to amphetamine leads to neuroadaptations in AMPA receptor signaling in this site that may contribute to the long-lasting maintenance of behavioral and incentive sensitization by psychostimulant drugs like amphetamine.","Transient overexpression of alpha-Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in the nucleus accumbens shell enhances behavioral responding to amphetamine.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Loweth JA and Singer BF and Baker LK and Wilke G and Inamine H and Bubula N and Alexander JK and Carlezon WA Jr and Neve RL and Vezina P","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:07:17,-1,2021-04-07 19:24:37,,,,,,,,

Although these processes can complement regulatory mechanisms in the control of eating by providing opportunities for the anticipation of upcoming needs, they may also contribute to inappropriate or pathological consumption patterns by overriding internal regulatory signals. In this article, we first review some of the ways in which associative learning can contribute to the control of feeding, and then describe a neural systems analysis of a simple animal model of the control of feeding by Pavlovian-conditioned stimuli (CSs). Food-sated rats increase their food consumption after presentation of CSs that were previously paired with food while the rats were food-deprived. This cue-potentiated feeding is independent of conditioned approach responses, and is at least somewhat specific to the foods associated with those CSs. A series of studies that used neuroanatomical tract tracing, immediate early gene expression, and neurotoxic disconnection lesion techniques implicated circuitry that includes the basolateral complex of the amygdala, the lateral hypothalamus, and the medial prefrontal cortex, but not the amygdala central nucleus, nucleus accumbens, or lateral orbitofrontal cortex, in cue-potentiated feeding. These studies also showed dissociations between cue-potentiated feeding and other learned motivational phenomena that are known to depend on function of amygdala systems. The data suggest that cue-potentiated feeding is uniquely mediated by cortical and amygdalar neurons that directly target the lateral hypothalamus, and thus gain access to hypothalamic neuropeptide and other systems involved in the promotion and suppression of eating.","A neural systems analysis of the potentiation of feeding by conditioned stimuli.","Physiology & behavior","Holland PC and Petrovich GD","",-1,2021-04-11 19:35:23,1,2021-04-02 13:28:07,-1,2021-04-09 15:53:03,,,,,,,,

During Pavlovian learning, previously neutral stimuli that predict rewards can acquire motivational properties, becoming attractive and desirable incentive stimuli. However, whether a cue acts solely as a predictor of reward, or also serves as an incentive stimulus, differs between individuals. Thus, individuals vary in the degree to which cues bias choice and potentially promote maladaptive behaviour. Here we use rats that differ in the incentive motivational properties they attribute to food cues to probe the role of the neurotransmitter dopamine in stimulus-reward learning. We show that intact dopamine transmission is not required for all forms of learning in which reward cues become effective predictors. Rather, dopamine acts selectively in a form of stimulus-reward learning in which incentive salience is assigned to reward cues. In individuals with a propensity for this form of learning, reward cues come to powerfully motivate and control behaviour. This work provides insight into the neurobiology of a form of stimulus-reward learning that confers increased susceptibility to disorders of impulse control.","A selective role for dopamine in stimulus-reward learning.","Nature","Flagel SB and Clark JJ and Robinson TE and Mayo L and Czuj A and Willuhn I and Akers CA and Clinton SM and Phillips PE and Akil H","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:55:09,-1,2021-04-11 19:13:45,,,,,,,,

Here we propose that these early diverse manifestations reflect a heightened ability of emotionally salient stimuli to activate dopamine pathways that foster behavioral approach. If substance use is initiated, these at-risk youth can also develop heightened responses to drug-paired cues. Through conditioning and drug-induced sensitization, these effects strengthen and accumulate, leading to responses that exceed those elicited by other rewards. At the same time, cues not paired with drug become associated with comparatively lower dopamine release, accentuating further the difference between drug and non-drug rewards.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of height and weight measurements from 5555 adult men and women aged 20 years or older obtained in 2007-2008 as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative sample of the US population. Data from the NHANES obtained in 2007-2008 were compared with results obtained from 1999 through 2006. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Estimates of the prevalence of overweight and obesity in adults. Overweight was defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 25.0 to 29.9. Obesity was defined as a BMI of 30.0 or higher. RESULTS: In 2007-2008, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity was 33.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 31.6%-36.0%) overall, 32.2% (95% CI, 29.5%-35.0%) among men, and 35.5% (95% CI, 33.2%-37.7%) among women. The corresponding prevalence estimates for overweight and obesity combined (BMI > or = 25) were 68.0% (95% CI, 66.3%-69.8%), 72.3% (95% CI, 70.4%-74.1%), and 64.1% (95% CI, 61.3%-66.9%). Obesity prevalence varied by age group and by racial and ethnic group for both men and women. Over the 10-year period, obesity showed no significant trend among women (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] for 2007-2008 vs 1999-2000, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.89-1.32]).

We have reported that shipping mice during the peripubertal/adolescent period results in decreased induction of feminine sexual behavior by estradiol and progesterone in adult female mice. To study further the factors involved in this decreased behavioral response, female mice were exposed to a variety of experimental stressors when 6 wk old. Effects of peripubertal/adolescent exposure to these stressors on acute plasma corticosterone levels and changes in body weight and adult behavioral response to estradiol and progesterone were assessed. Although restraint for three daily 3-h periods, 36-h food deprivation, or a multiple stressor regimen acutely increased plasma corticosterone levels and reduced body weight, only exposure to particular doses of the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1-1.5 mg/kg body weight, doses that induced moderate levels of sickness behavior in these studies) resulted in reduced behavioral response to estradiol and progesterone in adulthood. Like the effects of shipping, the effects of LPS on adult feminine sexual behavior appear most robust when injected at 6 wk old and are limited to exposure during a vulnerable period at approximately 4-6 wk of age. Therefore, an immune stressor during the peripubertal/adolescent period, but not restraint, food restriction, or a combined stressor, has an enduring influence on behavioral response to estradiol and progesterone. This demonstrates that the decreased response to estradiol and progesterone is not a general response to all stressors during this developmental stage.","Enduring influences of peripubertal/adolescent stressors on behavioral response to estradiol and progesterone in adult female mice.","Endocrinology","Laroche J and Gasbarro L and Herman JP and Blaustein JD","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 02:17:33,-1,2021-04-06 19:11:44,,,,,,,,

Groups received 1-hour SVS access everyday (7D group), 1-hour SVS access intermittently, 3 days/week (3D group), or no SVS access (Naive group). By the second week 3D rats began to display a disordered eating pattern. After 28 days on this feeding schedule SVS was withdrawn and anxiety was measured in an elevated plus maze. Motivation was assessed through operant performance for 10% sucrose on a progressive ratio schedule and craving was examined with a reinstatement test for lever pressing following extinction. Initial measures of anxiety and motivation found no differences among groups. However, when food was deprived overnight, there was a greater increase in lever pressing in the 3D group compared to 7D and Naive rats. Thus a history of intermittent SVS access enhanced the reinforcing value of sucrose, but only under deprivation conditions. Interestingly, reinstatement of responding for sucrose was present only in the Naive group.

A sample of 124 women were categorized into one of four groups based upon high and low scores on measures of Dietary Restraint and Disinhibition using the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire. Half of the participants in each group consumed a high sugar/high fat chocolate pudding as a dietary preload. All participants were given a meal comprised of a standard macaroni and beef product. The interaction of Dietary Restraint and Disinhibition was related to differences in body mass. The Dietary Restraint factor was related to self-reported pathological eating behavior and influenced both perceived hunger and subjective hunger ratings. However, actual eating behavior measured by calories consumed and rate of intake was unrelated to the Dietary Restraint factor. Disinhibition was associated with excessive eating, an increased rate of eating, self-reports of eating disorder symptomatology, and perceived hunger. Hence, actual eating behavior was significantly influenced by the ingestive motivational factor, Disinhibition, but not by the cognitive factor, Dietary Restraint. These data also suggest that the Disinhibition construct is measuring overeating rather than disinhibited eating which implies the disruption of Dietary Restraint.","Association of dietary restraint and disinhibition with eating behavior, body mass, and hunger.","Eating and weight disorders : EWD","Smith CF and Geiselman PJ and Williamson DA and Champagne CM and Bray GA and Ryan DH","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 14:44:23,-1,2021-04-03 21:38:28,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we sought to determine whether sugar-dependent rats would show increased intake of unsweetened ethanol and, conversely, whether intermittent access to ethanol would augment sugar consumption. In Experiment 1, with intermittent versus ad libitum access to ethanol, Sprague-Dawley rats were given escalating concentrations of ethanol (1%, 2%, 4%, 7%, and 9%) over the course of 20 days. Rats in the intermittent ethanol access group, with 12-h daily access, consumed more 4%, 7%, and 9% ethanol during the first hour of access, and more 9% ethanol daily, than did rats in the ad libitum ethanol access group. In Experiment 2, with ethanol as a gateway to sugar intake, the rats from Experiment 1 were switched to 10% sucrose with 12-h daily access for 1 week. Rats in the intermittent ethanol access group consumed significantly more sugar than was consumed by rats in a control group with no prior ethanol experience. In Experiment 3, with sugar as a gateway to ethanol to determine whether sugar dependence leads to increased ethanol intake, four groups were maintained for 21 days according to the following designations: intermittent access to sugar and chow, ad libitum access to sugar and chow, intermittent access to chow, or ad libitum access to chow. Four days later, all groups were switched to intermittent ethanol access, as described in Experiment 1. The group with intermittent access to sugar and chow consumed the most 9% ethanol, supporting the suggestion that sugar dependence alters a rat's proclivity to drink ethanol.

Despite these consistent findings, the mechanism for the increased risk of obesity following developmental trauma is unknown. It has been suggested that psychological dysfunction, including the presence of disordered eating behavior, may account for the added risk of adult obesity. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the prevalence and severity of different types of early traumatic life events, assessed the presence of co-existing psychiatric disorders and measured adult attachment style in a sample of 200 subjects including non-obese healthy volunteers and obese participants undergoing a psychiatric assessment to determine suitability for bariatric surgery. Participants who scored higher on a scale measuring the severity of traumatic events experienced during the first 15years of their lives were more likely to be obese at the time of testing. The exclusion of the participants who experienced physical and/or sexual abuse did not change the results of statistical analysis. Severity of early trauma remained a significant predictor of adult obesity when the influence of psychiatric diagnosis and anxious attachment was taken into account. These findings suggest that: (1) not only sexual or physical abuse but also less severe forms of early-life stress are linked to the development of obesity later in life; and (2) psychological dysfunction is not the only mechanism mediating the elevated risk of obesity in persons exposed to early-life trauma.","Early trauma and adult obesity: is psychological dysfunction the mediating mechanism?","Physiology & behavior","D'Argenio A and Mazzi C and Pecchioli L and Di Lorenzo G and Siracusano A and Troisi A","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 02:17:07,-1,2021-04-06 19:11:32,,,,,,,,

Current theoretical interpretations of impulsive choice are reviewed, and a synthesis of these ideas, the 'multiplicative hyperbolic model of choice', is presented. The model assumes that the value of a positive reinforcer increases as a hyperbolic function of its size, and decreases as a hyperbolic function of its delay and the odds against its occurrence. Each hyperbolic function contains a single discounting parameter which quantifies the organism's sensitivity to the variable in question. The hyperbolic discounting functions combine multiplicatively to determine the overall value of the reinforcer. Equivalent functions are postulated to govern the (negative) value of aversive events, the net value of an outcome reflecting the algebraic sum of the positive and negative values. The model gives rise to a quantitative methodology for studying impulsive choice, based on a family of linear indifference (null) equations, which describe performance under conditions of indifference, when the values of the reinforcers are assumed to be equal. This methodology may be used to identify individual differences in sensitivity to the magnitude, delay and probability of reinforcement. The methodology is also suitable for the quantitative evaluation of the effects of some pharmacological interventions on discounting parameters.

The importance of cocaine-induced loss of glutamate homeostasis is revealed by N-acetylcysteine restoring cystine-glutamate exchange and attenuating reinstatement to cocaine seeking. Another regulator of extracellular glutamate is the glial glutamate transporter GLT-1. We hypothesized that cocaine self-administration reduces GLT-1 and that GLT-1 upregulation inhibits cocaine seeking. METHODS: We measured [(3)H] glutamate uptake and protein expression of GLT-1 and xCT, the catalytic subunit of the cystine-glutamate exchanger, following cocaine self-administration and 3 weeks of extinction training. We also examined the affect of ceftriaxone (previously shown to increase GLT-1) and N-acetylcysteine treatment on the expression of GLT-1 and xCT. Ceftriaxone was also tested for the capacity to inhibit cue- and cocaine-induced relapse. RESULTS: Cocaine self-administration reduced glutamate uptake and the expression of both GLT-1 and xCT. Ceftriaxone restored GLT-1 and xCT levels and prevented cue- and cocaine-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. N-acetylcysteine also restored GLT-1 and xCT levels.

In Experiment 2 the light was again paired immediately with the unconditioned stimulus (US), whereas in Experiments 3 and 4 it signaled a tone which in turn signaled the US. In these three experiments we again found that continuous reinforcement resulted in a decline in the strength of light orientation. These studies also revealed that under conditions of partial reinforcement, orientation to the light was sustained. Experiment 5 demonstrated that the decline in light orientation with a continuous reinforcement procedure can be retarded either by preexposing the light for a number of trials prior to conditioning or by intermixing reinforced light trials with nonreinforced presentations of a tone. This experiment also revealed that reversing the reinforcement contingency associated with the tone restored orientation to the light.

When attributed to reward-predicting stimuli (cues), incentive salience triggers a pulse of 'wanting' and an individual is pulled toward the cues and reward. A key computational question is how incentive salience is generated during a cue re-encounter, which combines both learning and the state of limbic brain mechanisms. Learning processes, such as temporal-difference models, provide one way for stimuli to acquire cached predictive values of rewards. However, empirical data show that subsequent incentive values are also modulated on the fly by dynamic fluctuation in physiological states, altering cached values in ways requiring additional motivation mechanisms. Dynamic modulation of incentive salience for a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (CS or cue) occurs during certain states, without necessarily requiring (re)learning about the cue. In some cases, dynamic modulation of cue value occurs during states that are quite novel, never having been experienced before, and even prior to experience of the associated unconditioned reward in the new state. Such cases can include novel drug-induced mesolimbic activation and addictive incentive-sensitization, as well as natural appetite states such as salt appetite. Dynamic enhancement specifically raises the incentive salience of an appropriate CS, without necessarily changing that of other CSs. Here we suggest a new computational model that modulates incentive salience by integrating changing physiological states with prior learning. We support the model with behavioral and neurobiological data from empirical tests that demonstrate dynamic elevations in cue-triggered motivation (involving natural salt appetite, and drug-induced intoxication and sensitization). Our data call for a dynamic model of incentive salience, such as presented here. Computational models can adequately capture fluctuations in cue-triggered 'wanting' only by incorporating modulation of previously learned values by natural appetite and addiction-related states.","A neural computational model of incentive salience.","PLoS computational biology","Zhang J and Berridge KC and Tindell AJ and Smith KS and Aldridge JW","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 15:09:44,-1,2021-04-11 19:28:03,,,,,,,,

An extensive series of studies in rats has demonstrated that baclofen and other GABA(B) agonists reduce cocaine self-administration in an apparently specific manner. METHODS: A number of schedules of reinforcement, including fixed-ratio, progressive-ratio and discrete trials procedures, have been used to model various aspects of cocaine reinforcement and addiction. RESULTS: The results show that systemic pretreatment with baclofen can reduce cocaine intake at doses that do not affect responding for other positive reinforcers, such as food. Direct intracerebral injections of baclofen into the ventral tegmental area also produce a specific reduction in cocaine self-administration, suggesting that an inhibition of dopaminergic neurons may be responsible for the effect. Recent clinical evidence and case reports indicate some therapeutic value for baclofen in controlling cocaine intake and craving, although the evidence from controlled clinical trials has been less than convincing. Perhaps the most intriguing data come from human imaging studies, wherein cocaine addicts report increased cocaine craving and activation of orbital-frontal cortex, anterior cingulate and amygdala when shown videotapes of drug paraphernalia and other addicts taking cocaine. The craving is reduced and the limbic activation is eliminated in cocaine-dependent patients who had been taking baclofen (10-20 mg twice daily) for 7-10 days. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic clinical studies of GABA(B) agonists are needed to determine the extent to which these drugs might serve as tools to promote abstinence in cocaine users seeking treatment for their addiction. Several areas must still be addressed, including potential side-effects that may limit compliance and whether GABA(B) agonists interfere with other, non-drug-related behaviours.","A potential role for GABA(B) agonists in the treatment of psychostimulant addiction.","Alcohol and alcoholism (Oxford, Oxfordshire)","Brebner K and Childress AR and Roberts DC","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:13:10,-1,2021-04-09 15:29:02,,,,,,,,

In this regard, Thanos et al. [J. Neurochem. 78 (2001) 1094] and associates found increases in the dopamine D2 receptors (DRD2) via adenoviral vector delivery of the DRD2 gene into the nucleus accumbens, significantly reduced both ethanol preference (43%) and alcohol intake (64%) of ethanol preferring rats, which recovered as the DRD2, returned to baseline levels. This DRD2 overexpression similarly produced significant reductions in ethanol non-preferring rats, in both alcohol preference (16%) and alcohol intake (75%). This work further suggests that high levels of DRD2 may be protective against alcohol abuse [JAMA 263 (1990) 2055; Arch, Gen. Psychiatr. 48 (1991) 648]. The DRD2 A1 allele has also been shown to associate with heroin addicts in a number of studies. In addition, other dopaminergic receptor gene polymorphisms have also associated with opioid dependence. For example, Kotler et al. [Mol. Phychiatr. 3 (1997) 251] showed that the 7 repeat allele of the DRD4 receptor is significantly overpresented in the opioid-dependent cohort and confers a relative risk of 2.46. This has been confirmed by Li et al. [Mol. Psychiatry 2 (1997) 413] for both the 5 and 7 repeat alleles in Han Chinese case control sample of heroin addicts. Similarly Duaux et al. [Mol. Psychiatry 3 (1998) 333] in French Heroin addicts, found a significant association with homozygotes alleles of the DRD3-Bal 1. A study from NIAAA, provided evidence which strongly suggests that DRD2 is a susceptibility gene for substance abusers across multiple populations (2003). Moreover, there are a number of studies utilizing amino-acid and enkephalinase inhibition therapy showing reduction of alcohol, opiate, cocaine and sugar craving behavior in human trials (see Table 1). Over the last decade, a new rapid method to detoxify either methadone or heroin addicts utilizing Trexan sparked interest in many treatment centers throughout the United States, Canada, as well as many countries on a worldwide basis. In using the combination of Trexan and amino-acids, results were dramatic in terms of significantly enhancing compliance to continue taking Trexan. The average number of days of compliance calculated on 1000 patients, without amino-acid therapy, using this rapid detoxification method is only 37 days. In contrast, the 12 subjects tested, receiving both the Trexan and amino-acid therapy was relapse-free or reported taking the combination for an average of 262 days (p < 0.0001F). Thus coupling amino-acid therapy and enkephalinase inhibition while blocking the delta-receptors with a pure narcotic antagonist may be quite promising as a novel method to induce rapid detox in chronic methadone patients. This may also have important ramifications in the treatment of both opiate and alcohol-dependent individuals, especially as a relapse prevention tool. It may also be interesting too further test this hypothesis with the sublingual combination of the partial opiate mu receptor agonist buprenorphrine.","Narcotic antagonists in drug dependence: pilot study showing enhancement of compliance with SYN-10, amino-acid precursors and enkephalinase inhibition therapy.","Medical hypotheses","Chen TJ and Blum K and Payte JT and Schoolfield J and Hopper D and Stanford M and Braverman ER","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 15:12:07,-1,2021-04-11 19:28:41,,,,,,,,

PARTICIPANTS AND MEASUREMENTS: The sample included 154 boys living in economically deprived neighborhoods. Impulsivity measures comprised self-reports, teacher ratings and laboratory tasks, and were administered during early adolescence. Gambling behavior was assessed at age 17 using a self-report measure. Early gambling behavior and socio-demographic information were also collected for control purposes. FINDINGS: Results revealed that a self-report measure of impulsiveness and a card-sorting task significantly predicted problem gambling, even after controlling for socio-demographic variables, early gambling behavior and other personality variables such as aggressiveness and anxiety. Moreover, the predictive link held across all levels of aggressiveness and anxiety. Both impulsivity measures seemed to tap an inability to foresee negative consequences and an inability to stop responding despite unfavorable contingencies.

Here, we show how the hedonic 'liking' and motivation 'wanting' signals for a sweet reward are distinctly modulated and tracked in this circuit separately from signals for Pavlovian predictions (learning). Animals first learned to associate a fixed sequence of Pavlovian cues with sucrose reward. Subsequent intraaccumbens microinjections of an opioid-stimulating drug increased the hedonic liking impact of sucrose in behavior and firing signals of ventral pallidum neurons, and likewise, they increased incentive salience signals in firing to the reward-proximal incentive cue (but did not alter firing signals to the learned prediction value of a reward-distal cue). Microinjection of a dopamine-stimulating drug instead enhanced only the motivation component but did not alter hedonic impact or learned prediction signals. Different dedicated neuronal subpopulations in the ventral pallidum tracked signal enhancements for hedonic impact vs. incentive salience, and a faster firing pattern also distinguished incentive signals from slower hedonic signals, even for a third overlapping population. These results reveal separate neural representations of wanting, liking, and prediction components of the same reward within the nucleus accumbens to ventral pallidum segment of mesocorticolimbic circuitry.","Disentangling pleasure from incentive salience and learning signals in brain reward circuitry.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","Smith KS and Berridge KC and Aldridge JW","",-1,2021-04-11 19:35:28,0,2021-04-02 14:51:37,-1,2021-04-11 19:27:12,,,,,,,,

It has a reduced potential for abuse or misuse compared with methadone and buprenorphine alone, and has a long half-life allowing less frequent dosing. Buprenorphine/naloxone appears to be well suited for the management of opioid dependence in an office-based setting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a buprenorphine/naloxone combination treatment in an office-based setting. Therefore, we evaluated the effect on misuse/diversion, quality of care, quality of life and service delivery. Seventy-eight patients were switched to buprenorphine/naloxone from either methadone or buprenorphine alone; the median duration of previous buprenorphine or methadone treatment was 10 years. Patients received buprenorphine/naloxone and were evaluated throughout a 1-year follow-up period. Treatment was self-administered by the patients every 2 weeks and the mean buprenorphine dosage at 1 year was 8 mg/day. Comparisons were made before and after the switch for patients who switched from buprenorphine alone to buprenorphine/naloxone. Switching to buprenorphine/naloxone was not associated with clinically relevant problems in 50% of patients studied. Buprenorphine/naloxone provided satisfactory coverage of withdrawal symptoms in 78.1% of patients, and 50% of patients were satisfied with buprenorphine/naloxone therapy. Seventy-eight per cent of patients reported improved psychosocial functioning. The majority of patients (approximately 85%) were negative for opioids during toxicological testing. A significantly higher proportion of treatment recipients were highly satisfied during buprenorphine/naloxone administration (p < 0.001 compared with buprenorphine given before the switch). Other outcomes were similar during buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone administration. Fortnightly self-administration of buprenorphine/naloxone appeared to be cost saving for the clinic.

Animals exposed to amphetamine IP or in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) showed a sensitized locomotor response when challenged with amphetamine weeks later. Both exposure routes also increased DeltaFosB levels in the NAcc. Further characterization of these DeltaFosB+ neurons, however, revealed that amphetamine had no effect on dendritic spine density or size, indicating that these neurons do not undergo changes in dendritic spine morphology that accompany the expression of nonassociative sensitization. Additional experiments determined how neurons in the NAcc contribute to the expression of associative conditioning. A discrimination learning procedure was used to expose rats to IP or VTA amphetamine either Paired or Unpaired with an open field. As expected, compared with Controls, Paired rats administered IP amphetamine subsequently showed a conditioned locomotor response when challenged with saline in the open field, an effect accompanied by an increase in c-Fos+ neurons in the medial NAcc. Further characterization of these c-Fos+ cells revealed that Paired rats showed an increase in the density of dendritic spines and the frequency of medium-sized spines in the NAcc. In contrast, Paired rats previously exposed to VTA amphetamine showed neither conditioned locomotion nor conditioned c-Fos+ expression. Together, these results suggest a role for c-Fos+ neurons in the medial NAcc and rapid changes in the morphology of their dendritic spines in the expression of conditioning evoked by amphetamine-paired contextual stimuli.","Drug-Paired Contextual Stimuli Increase Dendritic Spine Dynamics in Select Nucleus Accumbens Neurons.","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Singer BF and Bubula N and Li D and Przybycien-Szymanska MM and Bindokas VP and Vezina P","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:23:17,-1,2021-04-09 15:50:22,,,,,,,,

HCR coupled with intermittent but not daily access to PF exaggerated rats' anorectic response to fluoxetine (p<0.05); was associated with a significant 71% and 58% reduction of 5-HT and dopamine, respectively, in the medial prefrontal cortex; and induced behaviors consistent with models of depression. HCR, irrespective of access to PF, abolished the strong association between 5-HT and dopamine turnover in the nucleus accumbens in control rats (r=0.71 vs. -0.06, p<0.01). Access to PF, irrespective of HCR, reduced hypothalamic dopamine.

Outbred rats had continuous free access to water and drinking fluids containing different concentrations of a drug for 7-9 months. After an abstinence period of 4-9 months, the drug was offered again (retest). Previous ethological classification of each rat and changes of housing conditions were used to study the modifiability of drug taking. With ethanol and the mu-agonistic opiate etonitazene, two stages followed each other. Controlled drug intake was adjusted to situational and individual variables. Social isolation of the rats raised the intake of ethanol and opiate. Dominant rats took less drugs than subordinate ones, but, in contrast to the latter, increased drug consumption after social disturbances. The adjustment of drug taking to social variables, was accompanied by changes in the dopaminergic and GABAA-ergic neurotransmission and by altered responses to acute drug administrations. Further, place preference, associated with reinforcing stimuli was modulated by subchronic sensitization/desensitization of dopaminergic transmission. Controlled drug intake lasted for 6-8 months, after which a spontaneous increase of drug consumption was found which latently continued during abstinence periods of 1 month. In the retest after abstinence, drug intake of these rats was strongly increased compared with both their previous consumption and that of drug-naive controls. Since drug taking could no longer be modulated by gustatory, environmental or individual factors (loss of control), it was considered as addictive. Addiction appeared to be specific to the kind of the drug. It persisted for the rest of the rat's life. After long periods of abstinence, ethanol-addicted rats revealed a completely altered pattern of response to self-administered alcohol compared with controlled drinkers. Their dopaminergic D1-transmission was irreversibly altered. Drug addiction only developed when the rat had free choice between water and drug-containing solutions. Long-term forced administration of ethanol or opiate, only led to physical dependence bot not to addiction.

However, the Lewis rats were more likely to choose the smaller, immediate reinforcer earlier in the session, i.e., at shorter large-reinforcer delays, than the Fisher 344 rats. This difference in choice was statistically significant. Repeated administration of 3.0 mg/kg, i.p. clomipramine (mean of last five sessions) did not significantly alter choice, relative to baseline, for either strain.

The effects of these two dosing regimens were compared with our previous findings following administration of cocaine three times daily at 1-h intervals. Using receptor autoradiography, twice daily injections of cocaine produced an upregulation of mu opioid receptors in the rostral nucleus accumbens, rostral caudate putamen, and layer I of the rostral cingulate cortex, whereas single daily injections resulted in a significant increase in the nucleus accumbens only. Only small insignificant increases in kappa opioid receptor densities were found following either once or twice daily cocaine injections, whereas three daily injections produced an increase in kappa receptor density in the cingulate cortex, nucleus accumbens, and caudate putamen. Increased dopamine D1 receptor binding was found in the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle following twice daily cocaine injections, but not after single daily injections of the same total daily dose. These results demonstrate that the same total daily dose of cocaine administered in multiple small injections produces a greater effect on receptor regulation than a single larger injection.

The theory addresses three fundamental questions. The first is: why do addicts crave drugs? That is, what is the psychological and neurobiological basis of drug craving? The second is: why does drug craving persist even after long periods of abstinence? The third is whether 'wanting' drugs (drug craving) is attributable to 'liking' drugs (to the subjective pleasurable effects of drugs)? The theory posits the following. (1) Addictive drugs share the ability to enhance mesotelencephalic dopamine neurotransmission. (2) One psychological function of this neural system is to attribute 'incentive salience' to the perception and mental representation of events associated with activation of the system. Incentive salience is a psychological process that transforms the perception of stimuli, imbuing them with salience, making them attractive, 'wanted', incentive stimuli. (3) In some individuals the repeated use of addictive drugs produces incremental neuroadaptations in this neural system, rendering it increasingly and perhaps permanently, hypersensitive ('sensitized') to drugs and drug-associated stimuli. The sensitization of dopamine systems is gated by associative learning, which causes excessive incentive salience to be attributed to the act of drug taking and to stimuli associated with drug taking. It is specifically the sensitization of incentive salience, therefore, that transforms ordinary 'wanting' into excessive drug craving. (4) It is further proposed that sensitization of the neural systems responsible for incentive salience ('for wanting') can occur independently of changes in neural systems that mediate the subjective pleasurable effects of drugs (drug 'liking') and of neural systems that mediate withdrawal. Thus, sensitization of incentive salience can produce addictive behavior (compulsive drug seeking and drug taking) even if the expectation of drug pleasure or the aversive properties of withdrawal are diminished and even in the face of strong disincentives, including the loss of reputation, job, home and family. We review evidence for this view of addiction and discuss its implications for understanding the psychology and neurobiology of addiction.","The neural basis of drug craving: an incentive-sensitization theory of addiction.","Brain research.

Surprisingly, recent experiments in rats--by far the most frequently used animal model in this field--suggest that the value of cocaine is lower than previously thought. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we report a series of choice experiments that better define the relative position of cocaine on the value ladder of rats (i.e., preference rank-ordering of different rewards). Rats were allowed to choose either taking cocaine or drinking water sweetened with saccharin--a nondrug alternative that is not biologically essential. By systematically varying the cost and concentration of sweet water, we found that cocaine is low on the value ladder of the large majority of rats, near the lowest concentrations of sweet water. In addition, a retrospective analysis of all experiments over the past 5 years revealed that no matter how heavy was past cocaine use most rats readily give up cocaine use in favor of the nondrug alternative. Only a minority, fewer than 15% at the heaviest level of past cocaine use, continued to take cocaine, even when hungry and offered a natural sugar that could relieve their need of calories. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This pattern of results (cocaine abstinence in most rats; cocaine preference in few rats) maps well onto the epidemiology of human cocaine addiction and suggests that only a minority of rats would be vulnerable to cocaine addiction while the large majority would be resilient despite extensive drug use. Resilience to drug addiction has long been suspected in humans but could not be firmly established, mostly because it is difficult to control retrospectively for differences in drug self-exposure and/or availability in human drug users. This conclusion has important implications for preclinical research on the neurobiology of cocaine addiction and for future medication development.","Cocaine is low on the value ladder of rats: possible evidence for resilience to addiction.","PloS one","Cantin L and Lenoir M and Augier E and Vanhille N and Dubreucq S and Serre F and Vouillac C and Ahmed SH","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 02:14:50,-1,2021-04-06 19:08:18,,,,,,,,

Changes in dopamine transmission in axon terminal fields such as the nucleus accumbens appear to underlie the expression of sensitization, but the actions of drugs and stressors in the somatodendritic regions of the A10/A9 dopamine neurons seem critical for the initiation of sensitization. Manipulations that increase somatodendritic dopamine release and permit the stimulation of D1 dopamine receptors in this region induce changes in the dopamine system that lead to the development of long-term sensitization. However, it is not known exactly how the changes in the A10/A9 region are encoded to permit augmented dopamine transmission in the terminal field. One possibility is that the dopamine neurons of sensitized animals have become increasingly sensitive to excitatory pharmacological and environmental stimuli or desensitized to inhibitory regulation. Alternatively, changes in cellular activity or protein synthesis may result in a change in the presynaptic regulation of axon terminal dopamine release.","Dopamine transmission in the initiation and expression of drug- and stress-induced sensitization of motor activity.","Brain research.

However, after the third R-R/S cycle, food intakes of mice returned to normal levels.

However, the mechanisms, underlying neuroanatomy, and specificity of this neuroanatomy are not yet fully understood. METHOD: To address these issues, experienced cocaine users (N=17) and comparison subjects (N=14) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while viewing three separate films that portrayed 1 ) individuals smoking crack cocaine, 2) outdoor nature scenes, and 3) explicit sexual content. Candidate craving sites were identified as those that showed significant activation in the cocaine users when viewing the cocaine film. These sites were then required to show significantly greater activation when contrasted with comparison subjects viewing the cocaine film (population specificity) and cocaine users viewing the nature film (content specificity). RESULTS: Brain regions that satisfied these criteria were largely left lateralized and included the frontal lobe (medial and middle frontal gyri, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus), parietal lobe (bilateral inferior parietal lobule), insula, and limbic lobe (anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus). Of the 13 regions identified as putative craving sites, just three (anterior cingulate, right inferior parietal lobule, and the caudate/lateral dorsal nucleus) showed significantly greater activation during the cocaine film than during the sex film in the cocaine users, which suggests that cocaine cues activated similar neuroanatomical substrates as naturally evocative stimuli in the cocaine users. Finally, contrary to the effects of the cocaine film, cocaine users showed a smaller response than the comparison subjects to the sex film. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that cocaine craving is not associated with a dedicated and unique neuroanatomical circuitry; instead, unique to the cocaine user is the ability of learned, drug-related cues to produce brain activation comparable to that seen with nondrug evocative stimuli in healthy comparison subjects.","Cue-induced cocaine craving: neuroanatomical specificity for drug users and drug stimuli.","The American journal of psychiatry","Garavan H and Pankiewicz J and Bloom A and Cho JK and Sperry L and Ross TJ and Salmeron BJ and Risinger R and Kelley D and Stein EA","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 15:11:49,-1,2021-04-11 19:28:37,,,,,,,,

Moreover, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine: 5-HT) and GABA have been implicated in a variety of common motivational and motor-related functions partially ascribed in this brain area. We used immunoelectron microscopy of antisera directed against 5-HT and GABA in the same section of tissue to examine whether there were cellular substrates that might indicate more specific sites for functional interactions involving these transmitters in the shell region of the rat nucleus accumbens. Immunogold-silver labeling for GABA was localized to perikarya, dendrites, axons and axon terminals, whereas immunoperoxidase labeling for 5-HT was restricted to axons and axon terminals. Approximately half (187/366) of the 5-HT-immunoreactive axon terminals apposed or formed synaptic junctions with postsynaptic neurons. These junctions were mainly of the symmetric-type (83/187) characteristic of inhibitory transmitters, and were equally prevalent on dendrites with and without detectable gold-silver labeling for GABA. Of the 187 5-HT-labeled axon terminals with recognized synaptic contacts, 36% also showed convergence on a common dendrite with a GABA-labeled axon terminal. In addition, 5-HT- and GABA-immunoreactive axon terminals were commonly (83/366) identified in direct apposition to one another. Within a single plane of section, 41% of the apposed GABA-immunoreactive axon terminals formed symmetric-type junctions with dendrites or somata, whereas, the apposed 5-HT-labeled axon terminals rarely showed postsynaptic contacts. These results indicate that 5-HT-containing axon terminals may postsynaptically inhibit GABAergic neurons and their targets within the shell of the rat nucleus accumbens. Additionally, our results strongly suggest that, in this brain region, appositions between 5-HT and GABA axons and axon terminals may facilitate presynaptic interactions between these transmitter systems.","Pre- and postsynaptic sites for serotonin modulation of GABA-containing neurons in the shell region of the rat nucleus accumbens.","The Journal of comparative neurology","Van Bockstaele EJ and Chan J and Pickel VM","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-04-02 13:21:55,-1,2021-04-09 15:49:10,,,,,,,,

METHOD: To detect heightened sensitivity to fluoxetine, young female rats were used to determine a subthreshold anorectic dose (2 mg/kg, intraperitonally). Another group of rats was either fed ad libitum or given multiple CR (to 90% body weight) and refeeding-to-satiety cycles. One half of the rats were then either spared or subjected to foot shock stress before fluoxetine treatment. RESULTS: A history of CR alone produced bingelike eating on palatable food (p < .001) and, although stress did not affect intake, it rendered CR rats hypersensitive to the satiety effect of fluoxetine. The feeding-suppression was mainly for chow (p < .05) and the effect was abolished if the rats were in negative energy balance. DISCUSSION: Results support the utility of this animal model to elucidate serotonergic changes linking dieting to binge eating.

Despite the known consequences of obesity, behavioral noncompliance remains high, supporting the powerful rewarding properties of such foods. We hypothesized that exposure to preferred diets would result in an amelioration of stress responsivity via activation of reward pathways that would be reversed during dietary withdrawal, increasing the risk for relapse and treatment failure. METHODS: Mice were exposed to preferred diets high in fat or carbohydrates for 4 weeks and then were withdrawn to house chow. Behavioral, physiologic, and biochemical assays were performed to examine changes in stress and reward pathways. RESULTS: These studies revealed significant changes in arousal and anxiety-like behaviors, limbic corticotropin-releasing factor expression, and expression of reward-related signaling molecules in response to the highly preferred high-fat diet that was reversed by withdrawal. In a dietary-reinstatement model, mice withdrawn from the high-fat diet endured an aversive environment to gain access to the preferred food. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to a highly preferred diet high in fat reduces stress sensitivity, whereas acute withdrawal from such a diet elevates the stress state and reduces reward, contributing to the drive for dietary relapse.","Decreases in dietary preference produce increased emotionality and risk for dietary relapse.","Biological psychiatry","Teegarden SL and Bale TL","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-28 14:13:42,-1,2021-03-31 12:45:50,,,,,,,,

Here, we tested the hypothesis that dopamine release would be associated with increased excitement levels in Pathological Gamblers compared with Healthy Controls. DESIGN: Pathological Gamblers and Healthy Controls were experimentally compared in a non-gambling (baseline) and gambling condition. MEASUREMENTS: We used Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with the tracer raclopride to measure dopamine D 2/3 receptor availability in the ventral striatum during a non-gambling and gambling condition of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). After each condition participants rated their excitement level. SETTING: Laboratory experiment. PARTICIPANTS: 18 Pathological Gamblers and 16 Healthy Controls. FINDINGS: Pathological Gamblers with dopamine release in the ventral striatum had significantly higher excitement levels than Healthy Controls despite lower IGT performance. No differences in excitement levels and IGT performance were found between Pathological Gamblers and Healthy Controls without dopamine release. Pathological Gamblers showed a significant correlation between dopamine release and excitement level, while no such interaction was found in Healthy Controls. CONCLUSIONS: In pathological gamblers dopamine release in the ventral striatum appears to be associated with increased excitement levels despite lower IGT performance. The results might suggest a 'double deficit' function of dopamine in pathological gambling, where dopamine release reinforces maladaptive gambling through increasing excitement levels, reducing inhibition of risky decisions, or a combination of both.

We advance the hypothesis that a possible explanation for overeating is that processed foods with high concentrations of sugar and other refined sweeteners, refined carbohydrates, fat, salt, and caffeine are addictive substances. Therefore, many people lose control over their ability to regulate their consumption of such foods. The loss of control over these foods could account for the global epidemic of obesity and other metabolic disorders. We assert that overeating can be described as an addiction to refined foods that conforms to the DSM-IV criteria for substance use disorders. To examine the hypothesis, we relied on experience with self-identified refined foods addicts, as well as critical reading of the literature on obesity, eating behavior, and drug addiction. Reports by self-identified food addicts illustrate behaviors that conform to the 7 DSM-IV criteria for substance use disorders. The literature also supports use of the DSM-IV criteria to describe overeating as a substance use disorder. The observational and empirical data strengthen the hypothesis that certain refined food consumption behaviors meet the criteria for substance use disorders, not unlike tobacco and alcohol.

It is possible that nicotine might act directly on the dopamine terminals to release dopamine. This hypothesis was tested by infusing nicotine through a microdialysis probe into the nucleus accumbens of freely moving rats. Dopamine, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and homovanillic acid from the extracellular space were collected by microdialysis and measured by high pressure liquid chromatography. Nicotine increased extracellular dopamine in a dose-related manner. Systemic injection of the nicotine antagonist mecamylamine blocked the dopamine increase induced by local nicotine.

When the rats were partially food-deprived every third day, cocaine infusions more than doubled during that session. When saline was substituted for cocaine, responding diminished over a 10-day period (Extinction Phase), but when the rats were subsequently food-deprived every third day (Testing Phase), for a total of six cycles (20 sessions), high rates of responding for saline were reinstated only during food deprivation sessions. Seven control groups were included to investigate several questions regarding this effect. Group C-1 received cocaine but no food deprivation experience during the Training Phase, and Group C-2 received food deprivation experience without cocaine access. The results showed that simultaneous presentation of both the food deprivation condition and cocaine was necessary to reinstate food deprivation-induced increases in responding during the Testing Phase. To test for the importance of the contingency between responding and cocaine infusions during food deprivation (and satiation) in the Training phase, Group C-3 was yoked to Group E; they received the same number and pattern of infusions during the Training Phase, but infusions were not contingent upon lever-press responses. This group showed only small increases in saline-maintained responding due to food deprivation during the Testing Phase. Groups C-4 and C-5 were treated as Groups C-3 and E, respectively, except they were partially food-deprived during the 10-day Extinction Phase. Three of five rats in Group C-4 and all rats in Group C-5 showed no increases due to food deprivation during the Testing Phase. Group C-6 was pre-exposed to food deprivation before the experiment began, and Group C-7 was exposed to food deprivation only once during the Training Phase. Both procedures weakened the ability of food deprivation to produce high rates of saline-maintained responding.

ICSA studies in rodents have established that the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a site supporting morphine and ethanol reinforcement. ICPC studies confirmed that injection of morphine into the VTA produces conditioned place preference (CPP). Further confirmation that activation of opioid receptors within the VTA is reinforcing comes from the findings that the endogenous opioid peptide met-enkephalin injected into the VTA produces CPP, and that the mu- and delta-opioid agonists, DAMGO and DPDPE, are self-infused into the VTA. Activation of the VTA dopamine (DA) system may produce reinforcing effects in general because (a) neurotensin is self-administered into the VTA, and injection of neurotensin into the VTA produces CPP and enhances DA release in the nucleus accumbens (NAC), and (b) GABA(A) antagonists are self-administered into the anterior VTA and injections of GABA(A) antagonists into the anterior VTA enhance DA release in the NAC. The NAC also appears to have a major role in brain reward mechanisms, whereas most data from ICSA and ICPC studies do not support an involvement of the caudate-putamen in reinforcement processes. Rodents will self-infuse a variety of drugs of abuse (e.g. amphetamine, morphine, phencyclidine and cocaine) into the NAC, and this occurs primarily in the shell region. ICPC studies also indicate that injection of amphetamine into the shell portion of the NAC produces CPP. Activation of the DA system within the shell subregion of the NAC appears to play a key role in brain reward mechanisms. Rats will ICSA the DA uptake blocker, nomifensine, into the NAC shell; co-infusion with a D2 antagonist can block this behavior. In addition, rats will self-administer a mixture of a D1 plus a D2 agonist into the shell, but not the core, region of the NAC. The ICSA of this mixture can be blocked with the co-infusion of either a D1 or a D2 antagonist. However, the interactions of other transmitter systems within the NAC may also play key roles because NMDA antagonists and the muscarinic agonist carbachol are self-infused into the NAC. The medial prefrontal (MPF) cortex supports the ICSA of cocaine and phencyclidine. The DA system also seems to play a role in this behavior since cocaine self-infusion into the MPF cortex can be blocked by co-infusing a D2 antagonist, or with 6-OHDA lesions of the MPF cortex. Limited studies have been conducted on other CNS regions to elucidate their role in brain and drug reward mechanisms using ICSA or ICPC procedures. Among these regions, ICPC findings suggest that cocaine and amphetamine are rewarding in the rostral ventral pallidum (VP); ICSA and ICPC studies indicate that morphine is rewarding in the dorsal hippocampus, central gray and lateral hypothalamus. Finally, substance P mediated systems within the caudal VP (nucleus basalis magnocellularis) and serotonin systems of the dorsal and median raphe nuclei may also be important anatomical components involved in brain reward mechanisms. Overall, the ICSA and ICPC studies indicate that there are a number of receptors, neuronal pathways, and discrete CNS sites involved in brain reward mechanisms.","Localization of brain reinforcement mechanisms: intracranial self-administration and intracranial place-conditioning studies.","Behavioural brain research","McBride WJ and Murphy JM and Ikemoto S","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 02:58:41,-1,2021-03-29 16:18:56,,,,,,,,

Dopamine, a neurotransmitter that modulates rewarding properties of food, is likely to be involved. To test the hypothesis that obese individuals have abnormalities in brain dopamine activity we measured the availability of dopamine D2 receptors in brain. METHODS: Brain dopamine D2 receptor availability was measured with positron emission tomography (PET) and [C-11]raclopride (a radioligand for the dopamine D2 receptor). Bmax/Kd (ratio of the distribution volumes in striatum to that in cerebellum minus 1) was used as a measure of dopamine D2 receptor availability. Brain glucose metabolism was also assessed with 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG). FINDINGS: Striatal dopamine D2 receptor availability was significantly lower in the ten obese individuals (2.47 [SD 0.36]) than in controls (2.99 [0.41]; p < or = 0.0075). In the obese individuals body mass index (BMI) correlated negatively with the measures of D2 receptors (r=0.84; p < or = 0.002); the individuals with the lowest D2 values had the largest BMI. By contrast, neither whole brain nor striatal metabolism differed between obese individuals and controls, indicating that striatal reductions in D2 receptors were not due to a systematic reduction in radiotracer delivery. INTERPRETATION: The availability of dopamine D2 receptor was decreased in obese individuals in proportion to their BMI. Dopamine modulates motivation and reward circuits and hence dopamine deficiency in obese individuals may perpetuate pathological eating as a means to compensate for decreased activation of these circuits. Strategies aimed at improving dopamine function may be beneficial in the treatment of obese individuals.","Brain dopamine and obesity.","Lancet (London, England)","Wang GJ and Volkow ND and Logan J and Pappas NR and Wong CT and Zhu W and Netusil N and Fowler JS","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 02:58:52,-1,2021-03-29 16:20:04,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The design included a cross-sectional and a longitudinal study element. Ninety staff members (58 women and 32 men) of a large department store were assessed on four occasions over a 6-month period with measures of diet, weight, and perceived stress. Work stress was indexed in terms of the hours of work over the past 7 days, which provided an objective indicator of demand. RESULTS: Participants worked an average of 47 hours on the high-work-stress session compared with 32 hours on the low-work-stress session. The highest work-stress session was compared with the lowest work-stress session in the longitudinal analyses, and the moderating effects of gender and restrained eating were examined. High-workload periods were associated with higher energy and saturated fat and sugar intake. There was a significant moderating effect of restrained eating, with a hyperphagic response to work stress in restrained eaters, compared with no effect in unrestrained eaters. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the associations between restraint and stress-induced eating that have been observed in the laboratory extend to the real-life setting. They raise the possibility that restrained eaters are particularly vulnerable to adverse effects of stress on health, through influences on food intake.","Stress, dietary restraint and food intake.","Journal of psychosomatic research","Wardle J and Steptoe A and Oliver G and Lipsey Z","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 02:59:02,-1,2021-03-29 16:20:52,,,,,,,,

Clonidine pretreatment (200 micrograms/kg, i.p.) eliminated both the withdrawal symptoms and the DA decrease. These results support the view that morphine increases extracellular DA at times when the drug is rewarding and also suggest that the converse may be true; morphine withdrawal decreases DA release in association with the aversive state.","Dopamine microdialysis in the nucleus accumbens during acute and chronic morphine, naloxone-precipitated withdrawal and clonidine treatment.","Brain research","Pothos E and Rada P and Mark GP and Hoebel BG","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 02:59:34,-1,2021-03-29 16:54:56,,,,,,,,

Animals received either morphine (0, 3, 6 or 9 mg/kg SC) or naloxone (0, 0.01, 0.1 or 1 mg/kg SC). For repeated hot plate measures, rats were tested before and 60, 120, 180 and 240 min following morphine treatment, as well as 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after naloxone injection. For the single test schedule, rats were tested only once 60 min after morphine or 30 min after naloxone administration, or at 60, 120, 180, 240 and 300 min after 9 mg/kg morphine treatment. Behaviour was videotaped and analysed by an ethogram and ethological techniques. A cluster analysis revealed that the most frequently displayed patterns could be categorised into exploratory sniffing reactions (walk-sniff, immobile-sniff) and noxious-evoked elements, including primary (paw-licking, stamping), escape (jumping, leaning posture) and independent (hindleg-withdrawal) patterns. During repeated tests, morphine treatment induced: i) a maximum hypoalgesic effect 60 min post-injection (noxious-evoked patterns were significantly reduced), and ii) an unexpected 'thermal hyperreactivity rebound effect' after 120 min (paw-licking and hindleg-withdrawal were enhanced), although changes in hindpaw-licking are more indicative of a hyperalgesic rebound effect. Most changes were quite similar during the single test schedule at 60 and 120 min after morphine injection. With regard to naloxone treatment, jumping latency was significantly decreased during the repeated test schedule, but not on single exposure to the plate. Other elements were facilitated, however, in the single test (stamping, leaning posture, hindleg-withdrawal). The results indicated that both repeated and single tests paradigms are of value for testing the effects of morphine and naloxone on rats. However, under our conditions the single test paradigm gave a better picture of the overall effects of the drug. Learning as well as habituation and sensitization may mask certain effects during repeated tests.

The underlying mechanism of this hypothermic effect has been investigated in rats. The first consideration was that the temperature change was a reflection of delayed withdrawal but rats implanted with a morphine pellet 45 days earlier showed no significant change in temperature after a dose of naltrexone that caused marked withdrawal hypothermia in dependent rats implanted 3 days previously. A fall in core temperature was only induced in rats after doses of 80 and 160 mg/kg i.p. of naltrexone. Behavioral thermoregulatory studies revealed that the animals correct the falling body temperature by increased exposure to a radiant heat source indicating that the central thermostats had not been significantly affected by the drug. These data suggest that the major component in the hypothermic effect of naltrexone is activation of efferent heat loss pathways or peripheral heat loss mechanisms. Due to current suggestions that opiate receptors might represent the receptors for an endogenous transmitter the results are discussed in relation to this consideration. When compared to the sites and mechanism of action of opiates on thermoregulation the results with naltrexone lend little support to the hypothesis that the fall in temperature is due to displacement of an endogenous substance from central opiate receptors.","Naltrexone-induced hypothermia in the rat.","European journal of pharmacology","Ary M and Chesarek W and Sorensen SM and Lomax P","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 03:06:15,-1,2021-03-29 16:57:15,,,,,,,,

Although alcoholism has received the most attention, nicotine, heroin, and cocaine have all been shown to be influenced by heredity. Of course, the immediate goal is the reduction of drug craving and the prevention of relapse to compulsive drug taking. A medication that can aid in the maintenance of the opiate-free state is naltrexone, a specific opiate antagonist. Naltrexone is also a good example of an anticraving medication used in the treatment of alcoholism. Clinicians currently have two types of medication to aid in the treatment of tobacco use disorder, arguably the most important addiction. Bupropion and nicotine replacement can be given in a coordinated fashion to provide the best available results. At present, no medication is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the indication of cocaine addiction. Recently, however, five different medications, already approved for other purposes, have been found to be effective among cocaine addicts. Despite clinical trials that show benefit, anticraving medications are not well known and are underused by clinicians. Addiction is a heterogeneous condition, with variability in reactivity to the drug of abuse and to the medications available to treat it.

Instead of seeing meals as a problem of how intake serves metabolism and nutritional homeostasis, meals are now seen as a problem in behavioral neuroscience. The major developments underlying this significant change are behavioral, neurological, and theoretical. Behavioral analysis has shown that a central pattern generator in the caudal brainstem organizes eating movements and that the size of a liquid meal is determined by the number and size of clusters of licking. Neurologic analysis has shown that eating is under orosensory positive-feedback control and postingestive, preabsorptive, negative-feedback control. These feedback controls are activated by food ingested during a meal. The sensory information of the feedbacks is carried by afferent fibers that project to the caudal brainstem. The new theory is based on the fact that the feedback controls are stimulated by food acting directly on mucosal receptors along the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the end of the small intestine.

It was found that continuous sham feeding produced a significant and phasic peripheral insulin response in the absence of any significant changes of glycemia. The response was almost completely blocked by prior intravenous administration of 2 mg/kg of atropine methyl nitrate and potentiated by prior intravenous administration of 1.0 or 2.5 mg/kg of phentolamine. In spite of the larger insulin response after phentolamine, there was no hypoglycemia detected. Furthermore, continuous sham feeding did not produce a significant glucagon response, whereas real feeling did. The results demonstrate that cholinergic insulin release is triggered phasically by continuous ingestion of familiar food and that this insulin response is inhibited by an alpha-adrenergic sympathetic tone. It is further concluded that the increased glucose disposal produced by the neurally released insulin is not counteracted by a concomitant glucagon response or by direct adrenergic stimulation of hepatic glucose production.","Sham feeding-induced cephalic phase insulin release in the rat.","The American journal of physiology","Berthoud HR and Jeanrenaud B","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 03:07:05,-1,2021-03-29 17:05:27,,,,,,,,

Group 1 were the first 55 consecutive implanted British patients (76% male, 51% unemployed, 64% in social classes III - V). Group 2 were a second consecutive group of 46. Implants were inserted subcutaneously mainly during rapid opiate detoxification under general anaesthesia or sedation. The follow-up rate for group 1 was 100%. At 12 weeks after first implantation, 21% of group 1 patients and 26% of group 2 patients had apparently resumed opiate use. Thirty per cent of patients tested-out the blockade in the first week. None reported any opiate effects at less than 5 weeks after insertion. In other patients, typical blood NTX levels 4 - 5 weeks post-insertion were in the range 3 - 5 ng/ml, which is evidently enough to block 500 mg of pure diamorphine. NTX implants provide considerable protection against early relapse and may increase the likelihood of therapeutically useful periods of abstinence after opiate withdrawal. Troublesome tissue reactions were infrequent. Improvements in implant technology and duration are already occurring.

In support of this, we report here that striatal regions of sugar-dependent rats show alterations in dopamine and opioid mRNA levels similar to morphine-dependent rats. Specifically, after a chronic schedule of intermittent bingeing on a sucrose solution, mRNA levels for the D2 dopamine receptor, and the preproenkephalin and preprotachykinin genes were decreased in dopamine-receptive regions of the forebrain, while D3 dopamine receptor mRNA was increased. While morphine affects gene expression across the entire dopamine-receptive striatum, significant differences were detected in the effects of sugar on the nucleus accumbens and adjacent caudate-putamen. The effects of sugar on mRNA levels were of greater magnitude in the nucleus accumbens than in the caudate-putamen. These areas also showed clear differences in the interactions among the genes, especially between D3R and the other genes. This was revealed by a novel multivariate analysis method that identified cooperative interactions among genes, specifically in the nucleus accumbens but not the caudate-putamen. Finally, a role for these cooperative interactions in a load-sharing response to perturbations caused by sugar was supported by the finding of a different pattern of correlations between the genes in the two striatal regions. These findings support a major role for the nucleus accumbens in mediating the effects of naturally rewarding substances and extend an animal model for studying the common substrates of drug addiction and eating disorders.","Opiate-like effects of sugar on gene expression in reward areas of the rat brain.","Brain research.

At the same time obesity is an escalating health problem worldwide. Evidence is accumulating rapidly that stress related chronic stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and resulting excess glucocorticoid exposure may play a potential role in the development of visceral obesity. Since adequate regulation of energy and food intake under stress is important for survival, it is not surprising that the HPA axis is not only the 'conductor' of an appropriate stress response, but is also tightly intertwined with the endocrine regulation of appetite. Here we attempt to link animal and human literatures to tease apart how different types of psychological stress affect eating. We propose a theoretical model of Reward Based Stress Eating. This model emphasizes the role of cortisol and reward circuitry on motivating calorically dense food intake, and elucidating potential neuroendocrine mediators in the relationship between stress and eating. The addiction literature suggests that the brain reward circuitry may be a key player in stress-induced food intake. Stress as well as palatable food can stimulate endogenous opioid release. In turn, opioid release appears to be part of an organisms' powerful defense mechanism protecting from the detrimental effects of stress by decreasing activity of the HPA axis and thus attenuating the stress response. Repeated stimulation of the reward pathways through either stress induced HPA stimulation, intake of highly palatable food or both, may lead to neurobiological adaptations that promote the compulsive nature of overeating. Cortisol may influence the reward value of food via neuroendocrine/peptide mediators such as leptin, insulin and neuropeptide Y (NPY). Whereas glucocorticoids are antagonized by insulin and leptin acutely, under chronic stress, that finely balanced system is dysregulated, possibly contributing to increased food intake and visceral fat accumulation. While these mechanisms are only starting to be elucidated in humans, it appears the obesity epidemic may be exacerbated by the preponderance of chronic stress, unsuccessful attempts at food restriction, and their independent and possibly synergistic effects on increasing the reward value of highly palatable food.","Stress, eating and the reward system.","Physiology & behavior","Adam TC and Epel ES","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 03:07:57,-1,2021-03-29 17:24:22,,,,,,,,

This review describes our current understanding of enterostatin, a peptide that selectively reduces fat intake. Enterostatin is formed in the intestine by the cleavage of secreted pancreatic procolipase, the remaining colipase serving as an obligatory cofactor for pancreatic lipase during fat digestion. Enterostatin is also produced in the gastric mucosa and the mucosal epithelia of the small intestine. Procolipase gene transcription and enterostatin release into the gastrointestinal lumen are increased by high-fat diets. After feeding, enterostatin appears in the lymph and circulation. Enterostatin will selectively inhibit fat intake during normal feeding and in experimental paradigms that involve dietary choice. Its anorectic effect has been demonstrated in a number of species. Both peripheral and central sites of action have been proposed. The peripheral mechanism involves an afferent vagal signaling pathway to hypothalamic centers. The central responses are mediated through a pathway that includes both serotonergic and opioidergic components. Chronically, enterostatin reduces fat intake, bodyweight, and body fat. This response may involve multiple metabolic effects of enterostatin, which include a reduction of insulin secretion, an increase in sympathetic drive to brown adipose tissue, and the stimulation of adrenal corticosteroid secretion. A possible pathophysiological role is suggested by studies that have linked low enterostatin production and/or responsiveness to strains of rat that become obese and prefer dietary fat.

Basal ganglia function has been studied from the perspective of topographical segregation of processing within parallel circuits, with primary focus on motor control and cognition. Recent findings suggest, however, that the striatum can act as an integrated unit to modulate motivational state. We describe evidence that the striatal enkephalin system, which regulates the hedonic impact of preferred foods, undergoes coordinated gene expression changes that track current motivational state with regard to food intake. Striatal enkephalin gene expression is also downregulated by an intrastriatal infusion of a cholinergic muscarinic antagonist, a manipulation that greatly suppresses food intake. To account for these findings, we propose that signaling through a hypothalamic-midline thalamic-striatal axis impinges on the cholinergic interneurons of the striatum, which via their large, overlapping axonal fields act as a network to modulate enkephalin-containing striatal output neurons. A key relay in this circuit is the paraventricular thalamic nucleus, which receives convergent input from orexin-coded hypothalamic energy-sensing and behavioral state-regulating neurons, as well as from circadian oscillators, and projects to cholinergic interneurons throughout the striatal complex. We hypothesize that this system evolved to coordinate feeding and arousal, and to prolong the feeding central motivational state beyond the fulfillment of acute energy needs, thereby promoting 'overeating' and the consequent development of an energy reserve for potential future food shortages.","A proposed hypothalamic-thalamic-striatal axis for the integration of energy balance, arousal, and food reward.","The Journal of comparative neurology","Kelley AE and Baldo BA and Pratt WE","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 11:16:42,-1,2021-03-29 17:42:46,,,,,,,,

Several types of experimental obesity are associated with increased opiate production and/or increased numbers and sensitivity of opiate receptors. Research with experimental animals suggests that nutrients, particularly sugar, have an effect on feeding behavior that is mediated by opiates. For instance, the obesity-producing effect of a palatable diet in rodents is blocked by opiate antagonists. Stress induced feeding in rodents leads to preferential sucrose ingestion and is blocked by opiate antagonists and beta-endorphin. The effect of nutrients on the endogenous opiate system of humans is less clear. Clinical experience suggest that carbohydrates (sugar in particular) play a role in binge eating and obesity. Many binge eaters preferentially eat sweets during a binge. Many obese individuals consume more than half of their total daily calories as carbohydrates.

Repeated exposure to this drug systemically or exclusively in the cell body region of these neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) leads to long-lasting changes in dopaminergic function that can be assessed by increased locomotor activity and enhanced DA overflow in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) after re-exposure to the drug. Three experiments were conducted to evaluate the possibility that this enduring sensitized reactivity underlies compulsive drug self-administration. In all experiments, rats were pre-exposed to amphetamine and, starting 10 d later, their intravenous self-administration of the drug was assessed. In the first experiment, rats previously exposed to amphetamine systemically or exclusively in the VTA subsequently worked harder than untreated animals to obtain the drug when the work required to obtain successive infusions was increased progressively. In the second experiment, this progressively increasing workload was found to decrease the magnitude of amphetamine-induced DA overflow observed with successive infusions until responding ceased. Rats previously exposed to amphetamine were more resistant to this decline and more apt to maintain responding. Finally, in experiment three, a noncontingent priming injection of the drug produced a greater NAcc DA response and a greater parallel increase in lever pressing in drug compared with saline pre-exposed rats. Together, these results demonstrate a direct relation between drug-induced sensitization of midbrain dopamine neuron reactivity and the excessive pursuit and self-administration of an abused substance.","Sensitization of midbrain dopamine neuron reactivity promotes the pursuit of amphetamine.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Vezina P and Lorrain DS and Arnold GM and Austin JD and Suto N","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 11:21:52,-1,2021-03-29 18:55:48,,,,,,,,

Quantifying these will provide insight into the effects of recent trends and the implications of missed prevention opportunities. OBJECTIVES: To identify and quantify the leading causes of mortality in the United States. DESIGN: Comprehensive MEDLINE search of English-language articles that identified epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory studies linking risk behaviors and mortality. The search was initially restricted to articles published during or after 1990, but we later included relevant articles published in 1980 to December 31, 2002. Prevalence and relative risk were identified during the literature search. We used 2000 mortality data reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to identify the causes and number of deaths. The estimates of cause of death were computed by multiplying estimates of the cause-attributable fraction of preventable deaths with the total mortality data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Actual causes of death. RESULTS: The leading causes of death in 2000 were tobacco (435 000 deaths; 18.1% of total US deaths), poor diet and physical inactivity (365 000 deaths; 15.2%) [corrected], and alcohol consumption (85 000 deaths; 3.5%). Other actual causes of death were microbial agents (75 000), toxic agents (55 000), motor vehicle crashes (43 000), incidents involving firearms (29 000), sexual behaviors (20 000), and illicit use of drugs (17 000). CONCLUSIONS: These analyses show that smoking remains the leading cause of mortality. However, poor diet and physical inactivity may soon overtake tobacco as the leading cause of death. These findings, along with escalating health care costs and aging population, argue persuasively that the need to establish a more preventive orientation in the US health care and public health systems has become more urgent.","Actual causes of death in the United States, 2000.","JAMA","Mokdad AH and Marks JS and Stroup DF and Gerberding JL","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 12:05:21,-1,2021-03-29 18:56:00,,,,,,,,

The rates of substance abuse among eating disordered women are also examined. This review indicates that associations are stronger with bulimia, and 'bulimic' behaviors, than with anorexia nervosa. Analogously, bulimic anorectics report more substance use and abuse than restricters. The prevalence of drug abuse was not found to differ between the relatives of bulimics and anorectics.

However, a relatively complete characterization of their effects in rats reveals markedly different response profiles. Furthermore, whereas acute co-administration of amphetamine and PCP resulted in an increase in one component of stereotypy, repetitive head movements, two measures of locomotor activation, i.e., ambulation and nonfocused sniffing, were unchanged, and rearings were reduced. In addition, the response alterations which occur with repeated administration of these drugs did not display cross-sensitization. Thus, although repeated daily injections of amphetamine, which produced progressive locomotor augmentation, sensitized animals to the locomotor-stimulating effects of PCP, repeated PCP treatment, which also resulted in locomotor augmentation, decreased the locomotor response to a challenge injection of amphetamine. These findings suggest significant differences in the mechanisms underlying the effects of acute and repeated administration of PCP and amphetamine.","Acute and chronic behavioral interactions between phencyclidine (PCP) and amphetamine: evidence for a dopaminergic role in some PCP-induced behaviors.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior","Greenberg BD and Segal DS","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 12:05:48,-1,2021-03-29 19:00:19,,,,,,,,

Striking differences were found between the released amounts of DA (less than 7 fmol/min) and those of the metabolites (approx 0.5 pmol/min). It was calculated that 5% of the DA metabolites left the striatum via the push-pull cannula. The effects of systemic application of apomorphine, (+)-amphetamine, haloperidol or haloperidol in combination with amfonelic acid on the release of DA and its metabolites, were investigated. The release rate of DOPAC correlated well with the drug-induced changes of these metabolites in striatal tissue, however, this was not the case for HVA. The increase of striatal levels of DOPAC and HVA induced by the anaesthesia is a serious limitation of the method. To enable reliable estimation of the release of DA, 1 microM (+)-amphetamine had to be added to the perfusion medium (which may have modified the origin of DOPAC and HVA in the perfusates). (+)-Amphetamine (5 mg/kg, intravenous) induced a two- to threefold increase in the release of DA. Systemic administration of apomorphine, haloperidol or haloperidol in combination with amfonelic acid did not change the output of the neurotransmitter in the push-pull cannula. This implies that neuroleptics cause only a small and transient rise in DA release, whereas the pronounced and persisting increase in DOPAC and HVA seen after neuroleptics is the result of enhanced metabolism related to increased synthesis of DA.","The release of endogenous dopamine and its metabolites from rat striatum as detected in push-pull perfusates: effects of systematically administered drugs.","Pharmaceutisch weekblad.

The rats were trained to press different levers for these two reinforcers using a sucrose-substitution procedure. An aversion was then conditioned from either the ethanol solution or the food pellets by pairing consumption with illness induced by lithium chloride. When instrumental performance was subsequently tested in extinction, the rats pressed less on the pellet lever if the pellets, rather than the ethanol, had been devalued by aversion conditioning. By contrast, performance on the ethanol lever was unaffected by whether the ethanol or pellets were devalued. Moreover, noncontingent presentations of the devalued reinforcer had no impact on test performance. The differential resistance to outcome devaluation suggests that, in contrast to food seeking, alcohol seeking is a stimulus-response habit rather than a goal-directed action mediated by a representation of the action-outcome contingency.","Alcohol seeking by rats: action or habit?","The Quarterly journal of experimental psychology.

Rats from two sources showed evidence of sensitization to d-amphetamine, there being significantly greater rotation in response to the second dose than in response to the first dose; the d-amphetamine-induced rotational behavior of rats from the third source did not significantly change from one week to the next. However, the latter rats had a greater initial response to the first dose of d-amphetamine than did rats from the other two breeders. Further analysis revealed that, among rats from all three breeders, rats rotating weakly in response to d-amphetamine on the first test tended to rotate more on the second test whereas rats rotating strongly in response to d-amphetamine on the first test tended to rotate less on the second test. This relationship was found to apply to previously collected data as well and was discussed with reference to a proposed mechanism involving asymmetry in sensitization to d-amphetamine-induced release of striatal dopamine.

The mechanisms for controlling food intake involve a complicated interplay between peripheral systems (including gustatory stimulation, gastrointestinal peptide secretion, and vagal afferent nerve responses) and central nervous system (CNS) neuropeptides and/or monoamines. These neuronal systems include neuropeptides (CRH, opioids, neuropeptide-Y (NPY) and peptide YY (PYY), vasopressin and oxytocin, CCK, and leptin) and monamines (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine). In addition to regulating eating behavior, a number of CNS neuropeptides participate in the regulation of neuroendocrine pathways. Thus, clinical studies have evaluated the possibility that CNS neuropeptide alterations may contribute to dysregulated secretion of the gonadal hormones, cortisol, thyroid hormones and growth hormone in the eating disorders. Most of the neuroendocrine and neuropeptide alterations apparent during symptomatic episodes of AN and BN tend to normalize after recovery. This observation suggests that most of the disturbances are consequences rather than causes of malnutrition, weight loss and/or altered meal patterns. Still, an understanding of these neuropeptide disturbances may shed light on why many people with AN or BN cannot easily 'reverse' their illness and even after weight gain and normalized eating patterns, many individuals who have recovered from AN or BN have physiological, behavioral and psychological symptoms that persist for extended periods of time.","A review of neuropeptide and neuroendocrine dysregulation in anorexia and bulimia nervosa.","Current drug targets.

An extensive series of studies in rats has demonstrated that baclofen and other GABA(B) agonists reduce cocaine self-administration in an apparently specific manner. METHODS: A number of schedules of reinforcement, including fixed-ratio, progressive-ratio and discrete trials procedures, have been used to model various aspects of cocaine reinforcement and addiction. RESULTS: The results show that systemic pretreatment with baclofen can reduce cocaine intake at doses that do not affect responding for other positive reinforcers, such as food. Direct intracerebral injections of baclofen into the ventral tegmental area also produce a specific reduction in cocaine self-administration, suggesting that an inhibition of dopaminergic neurons may be responsible for the effect. Recent clinical evidence and case reports indicate some therapeutic value for baclofen in controlling cocaine intake and craving, although the evidence from controlled clinical trials has been less than convincing. Perhaps the most intriguing data come from human imaging studies, wherein cocaine addicts report increased cocaine craving and activation of orbital-frontal cortex, anterior cingulate and amygdala when shown videotapes of drug paraphernalia and other addicts taking cocaine. The craving is reduced and the limbic activation is eliminated in cocaine-dependent patients who had been taking baclofen (10-20 mg twice daily) for 7-10 days. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic clinical studies of GABA(B) agonists are needed to determine the extent to which these drugs might serve as tools to promote abstinence in cocaine users seeking treatment for their addiction. Several areas must still be addressed, including potential side-effects that may limit compliance and whether GABA(B) agonists interfere with other, non-drug-related behaviours.","A potential role for GABA(B) agonists in the treatment of psychostimulant addiction.","Alcohol and alcoholism (Oxford, Oxfordshire)","Brebner K and Childress AR and Roberts DC","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 12:09:44,-1,2021-03-29 19:24:16,,,,,,,,

Because fructose, unlike glucose, does not stimulate insulin secretion, we hypothesized that meals high in fructose would result in lower leptin concentrations than meals containing the same amount of glucose.

Meals were isocaloric in the two treatments. Postprandial glycemic excursions were reduced by 66 +/- 12%, and insulin responses were 65 +/- 5% lower (both P < 0.001) during HFr consumption. The area under the curve for leptin during the first 12 h (-33 +/- 7%; P < 0.005), the entire 24 h (-21 +/- 8%; P < 0.02), and the diurnal amplitude (peak - nadir) (24 +/- 6%; P < 0.0025) were reduced on the HFr day compared with the HGl day. In addition, circulating levels of the orexigenic gastroenteric hormone, ghrelin, were suppressed by approximately 30% 1-2 h after ingestion of each HGl meal (P < 0.01), but postprandial suppression of ghrelin was significantly less pronounced after HFr meals (P < 0.05 vs. HGl). Consumption of HFr meals produced a rapid and prolonged elevation of plasma triglycerides compared with the HGl day (P < 0.005). Because insulin and leptin, and possibly ghrelin, function as key signals to the central nervous system in the long-term regulation of energy balance, decreases of circulating insulin and leptin and increased ghrelin concentrations, as demonstrated in this study, could lead to increased caloric intake and ultimately contribute to weight gain and obesity during chronic consumption of diets high in fructose.","Dietary fructose reduces circulating insulin and leptin, attenuates postprandial suppression of ghrelin, and increases triglycerides in women.","The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism","Teff KL and Elliott SS and Tschop M and Kieffer TJ and Rader D and Heiman M and Townsend RR and Keim NL and D'Alessio D and Havel PJ","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 12:09:53,-1,2021-03-29 19:24:22,,,,,,,,

We review herein a series of studies in rats comparing the effects of manipulating Acb amino acid, opioid, acetylcholine, and dopamine systems on tests of free-feeding and food-reinforced operant responding. Results from our laboratory and in the literature support three general conclusions: (1) GABA output neurons localized exclusively within the Acb shell directly influence hypothalamic effector mechanisms for feeding motor patterns, but do not participate in the execution of more complex food-seeking strategies; (2) enkephalinergic neurons distributed throughout the Acb and caudate-putamen mediate the hedonic impact of palatable (high sugar/fat) foods, and these neurons are under modulatory control by striatal cholinergic interneurons; and (3) dopamine transmission in the Acb governs general motoric and arousal processes related to response selection and invigoration, as well as motor learning-related plasticity. These dissociations may reflect the manner in which these neurochemical systems differentially access pallido-thalamo-cortical loops reaching the voluntary motor system (in the case of opioids and dopamine), versus more restricted efferent connections to hypothalamic motor/autonomic control columns (in the case of Acb shell GABA and glutamate systems). Moreover, we hypothesize that while these systems work in tandem to coordinate the anticipatory and consummatory phases of feeding with hypothalamic energy-sensing substrates, the striatal opioid network evolved a specialized capacity to promote overeating of energy-dense foods beyond acute homeostatic needs, to ensure an energy reserve for potential future famine.","Corticostriatal-hypothalamic circuitry and food motivation: integration of energy, action and reward.","Physiology & behavior","Kelley AE and Baldo BA and Pratt WE and Will MJ","non-experimental study,study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 12:10:14,-1,2021-03-31 12:30:34,,,,,,,,

This study attempted to investigate several possible explanations for this phenomenon, in particular, the 'masking hypothesis.' This hypothesis states that dieters use overeating to mask their distress in other areas of their lives by eating when distressed so that they can attribute their distress to their overeating rather than to more uncontrollable aspects of themselves or their lives. In addition, comfort, learned helplessness, and distraction explanations were investigated. METHOD: Female college student subjects were led to believe that they had or had not failed at a cognitive task, then were either given ad libitum or just three small spoonfuls of ice cream to taste and rate. RESULTS: It was predicted that restrained subjects who ate ad libitum following failure would attribute more of their distress to their eating than would those who were allowed only a taste of ice cream. The results were more complicated than predicted. They indicated that the masking, distraction, and helplessness hypotheses all received some support in the present study and that they may work in tandem with each other. DISCUSSION: The results suggest that distress-induced overeating in restrained eaters may serve psychological functions for the individual, allowing for distraction from the distress or masking of the source of dysphoria. The possible relevance of these results to bulimic patients who may use their binges to mask the true source of their distress is discussed.","Distress and eating: why do dieters overeat?","The International journal of eating disorders","Polivy J and Herman CP","study with other mammals other than rat mice,study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 12:10:27,-1,2021-04-01 15:19:24,,,,,,,,

Do they mediate the hedonic impact of rewarding stimuli? Do they mediate hedonic reward learning and associative prediction? Our review of the literature, together with results of a new study of residual reward capacity after dopamine depletion, indicates the answer to both questions is 'no'. Rather, dopamine systems may mediate the incentive salience of rewards, modulating their motivational value in a manner separable from hedonia and reward learning. In a study of the consequences of dopamine loss, rats were depleted of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and neostriatum by up to 99% using 6-hydroxydopamine. In a series of experiments, we applied the 'taste reactivity' measure of affective reactions (gapes, etc.) to assess the capacity of dopamine-depleted rats for: 1) normal affect (hedonic and aversive reactions), 2) modulation of hedonic affect by associative learning (taste aversion conditioning), and 3) hedonic enhancement of affect by non-dopaminergic pharmacological manipulation of palatability (benzodiazepine administration). We found normal hedonic reaction patterns to sucrose vs. quinine, normal learning of new hedonic stimulus values (a change in palatability based on predictive relations), and normal pharmacological hedonic enhancement of palatability. We discuss these results in the context of hypotheses and data concerning the role of dopamine in reward. We review neurochemical, electrophysiological, and other behavioral evidence. We conclude that dopamine systems are not needed either to mediate the hedonic pleasure of reinforcers or to mediate predictive associations involved in hedonic reward learning. We conclude instead that dopamine may be more important to incentive salience attributions to the neural representations of reward-related stimuli. Incentive salience, we suggest, is a distinct component of motivation and reward. In other words, dopamine systems are necessary for 'wanting' incentives, but not for 'liking' them or for learning new 'likes' and 'dislikes'.","What is the role of dopamine in reward: hedonic impact, reward learning, or incentive salience?","Brain research.

Voluntary hyperphagia was induced by offering female rats a varied and palatable choice of human food items--the 'cafeteria diet'. There were four groups: control (normal chow), obese (continuous cafeteria diet), post-obese (cafeteria diet, then fasted to reduce weight to that of controls) and binge (cafeteria alternated with normal diet every few days). Animals were maintained on these diets for 60 days (phase I). They were then given a GnRH challenge on day 2 of dioestrus of the cycle. Twenty-four hours later, half of the animals in each group were killed for assessment of effects on their reproductive organs. The remaining animals were returned to normal diets and kept for a further 40 days, when the GnRH challenge was repeated and the animals were killed 24 h later (phase II). All animals on the cafeteria diet in phase I exhibited significant disruption of oestrous cyclicity irrespective of body weight. LH released in response to the first GnRH challenge showed a prolonged half-life, and/or increased rate of secretion in the obese and post-obese groups but in the binge group the secretory/clearance properties resembled those of control animals. After the second GnRH challenge at the end of phase II, however, the LH of the binge group appeared to have different secretory or clearance characteristics, whereas that of the previously obese animals had returned to normal. These data show ovarian cyclicity was disrupted by hyperphagia and irregular eating, even at normal body weight. Relating ovarian function to pituitary output in terms of LH, the effects of the continuous cafeteria diet did not appear to persist in the animals that returned to normal diets, but in the binge group the effect, presumably of the diet manipulation, was manifested after return to a normal eating pattern. This finding suggests that irregular eating habits may exert a direct (and acute) effect on the ovary, but that effects on the pituitary (and LH glycoforms) take longer to be expressed, explaining many features of bulimia nervosa.","Diet-induced loss of cyclic ovarian function at normal body weight in a rodent model for bulimia nervosa.","Journal of reproduction and fertility","Leigh AJ and Stock MJ and Lacey JH and Wilson CA","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc)",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 13:46:56,-1,2021-03-31 12:33:34,,,,,,,,

In two experiments exposure to palatable food stimuli led to increases in motivational (hunger) ratings and salivation, and was followed by overeating in restrained subjects compared with the control condition (no food during exposure) and a condition in which nonpreferred food was presented during the exposure phase. The food intake of unrestrained subjects, on the other hand, was reduced following exposure to palatable food in the first experiment. This shows that breakdown of dietary restraint can be induced by food stimuli even when the food does not constitute a preload. Mere exposure to the sight and smell of palatable food is sufficient to precipitate loss of dieting motivation. The effects of exposure on hunger and salivation were, in general, unrelated to food intake or degree of dietary restraint. Therefore, changes in hunger do not appear to directly mediate increased food intake in dieters. Instead, it is tentatively suggested that anxiety resulting from exposure to liked food may play a role both in disinhibiting eating and suppressing salivation in restrained subjects.","Breakdown of dietary restraint following mere exposure to food stimuli: interrelationships between restraint, hunger, salivation, and food intake.","Addictive behaviors","Rogers PJ and Hill AJ","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 13:49:18,-1,2021-03-31 12:45:40,,,,,,,,

Although eating disorders treatment in the absence of obesity treatment does not result in large weight losses, amelioration of binge eating does result in small weight losses and decreased weight regain over time.

However, little is known about effects of FR on DA synthetic activity in the mesoaccumbens and nigrostriatal pathways. In Experiment 1 of the present study, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene expression was measured in ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra, using real-time RT-PCR and in situ hybridization; no differences were observed between FR and ad libitum fed (AL) rats. In Experiment 2, TH protein levels, determined by Western blot, were found to be elevated in NAc and caudate-putamen (CPu) of FR relative to AL rats. In the absence of increased transcription, this may reflect a slowing of TH degradation. In Experiments 3 and 4, DA synthetic activity was assessed by Western blot measurement of TH phosphorylation at Ser40, and HPLC measurement of in vivo tyrosine hydroxylation rate, as reflected by DOPA accumulation following administration of a decarboxylase inhibitor (NSD-1015; 100 mg/kg, i.p.). Basal phospho-(Ser40)-TH levels did not differ between groups but DOPA accumulation was decreased by FR. Decreased DOPA synthesis, despite increased levels of TH protein, may reflect the inhibitory effect of increased DA binding to TH protein or decreased concentrations of cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin. Finally, in response to D-amphetamine (0.5 and 5.0 mg/kg, i.p.), phospho-(Ser40)-TH was selectively decreased in NAc of FR rats. This suggests increased feedback inhibition of DA synthesis-a possible consequence of postsynaptic receptor hypersensitivity, or increased extracellular DA concentration. These results indicate that FR increases TH protein levels, but may decrease the capacity for DA synthesis by decreasing TH activity. According to this scheme, the previously observed upregulation of striatal cell signaling and transcriptional responses to DA receptor agonist administration may include compensatory neuroadaptations.","Synthesis, protein levels, activity, and phosphorylation state of tyrosine hydroxylase in mesoaccumbens and nigrostriatal dopamine pathways of chronically food-restricted rats.","Brain research","Pan Y and Berman Y and Haberny S and Meller E and Carr KD","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc)",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 15:31:17,-1,2021-03-31 12:47:21,,,,,,,,

This effect appears to be similar to the neuroadaptation resulting from drugs of abuse and may underlay some pathological feeding behaviors. To further investigate the cellular mechanisms of these alterations, the present study used quantitative autoradiography and in situ hybridization to assess dopamine membrane transporter (DAT) protein density and mRNA expression in restricted-fed and free-fed adult male rats. The restricted feeding regimen consisted of daily limited access to either a normally preferred sucrose solution (0.3 M) or a less preferred chow in a scheduled (i.e., contingent) fashion for 7 days. Restricted-fed rats with the contingent sucrose access lost less body weight, ate more total food, and drank more fluid than free-fed, contingent food, or noncontingent controls. In addition, these animals had selectively higher DAT binding in the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area. This increase in protein binding also was accompanied by an increase in DAT mRNA levels in the ventral tegmental area. In contrast to the restricted-fed groups, no differential effect in DAT regulation was observed across free-fed groups. The observed alteration in behavior and DAT regulation suggest that neuroadaptation in the mesoaccumbens dopamine system develops in response to repeated feeding on palatable foods under dietary constraints. This supports the notion that similar cellular changes may be involved in restrictive eating disorders and bingeing.","Restricted feeding with scheduled sucrose access results in an upregulation of the rat dopamine transporter.","American journal of physiology.

The most probable explanation for these findings is that some, currently unknown, genetic variant, which is overrepresented in those with BED, interacts with DAT1 to suppress appetite in response to stimulant administration.

The resulting increase in action potential-induced exocytotic release of neurotransmitters, associated with behavioral sensitization, is thought to contribute to its addictive properties. We recently showed that activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) as well as dopamine (DA) D1 receptors in rat striatum causes tetrodotoxin-insensitive transporter-dependent GABA release. Since sustained changes in extracellular GABA levels may play a role in drug-induced neuronal hyperresponsiveness, we examined the acute and long-lasting effect of morphine on this nonvesicular GABA release in rat nucleus accumbens slices. The present study shows that morphine, through activation of mu-opioid receptors, reduces nonvesicular NMDA-induced [(3)H]GABA release in superfused nucleus accumbens slices. Moreover, prior repeated morphine treatment of rats (10 mg/kg, sc, 14 days) caused a reduction in NMDA-stimulated [(3)H]GABA release in vitro until at least 3 weeks after morphine withdrawal. This persistent neuroadaptive effect was not observed studying dopamine D1 receptor-mediated [(3)H]GABA release in nucleus accumbens slices. Moreover, this phenomenon appeared to be absent in slices of the caudate putamen. Interestingly, even a single exposure of rats to morphine (>2 mg/kg) caused a long-lasting inhibition of NMDA-induced release of GABA in nucleus accumbens slices. These data suggest that a reduction in nonvesicular GABA release within the nucleus accumbens, by enhancing the excitability of input and output neurons of this brain region, may contribute to the acute and persistently enhanced exocytotic release of neurotransmitters from nucleus accumbens neurons in morphine-exposed rats.","Morphine acutely and persistently attenuates nonvesicular GABA release in rat nucleus accumbens.","Synapse (New York, N.Y.)","Schoffelmeer AN and Wardeh G and Vanderschuren LJ","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 15:35:57,-1,2021-03-31 12:48:31,,,,,,,,

The present study investigated whether the rates of USVs as indices of withdrawal from a period of continuous access, depends on cocaine being self-administered versus given non-contingently. Five days after implantation of a jugular catheter, triads of rats that were matched for housing, food-training and surgery were placed into experimental chambers. The active rats were allowed to acquire self-administration of cocaine (0.5 mg) while the two yoked animals passively received either cocaine (0.5 mg) or saline according to the active animal's pattern of administration. Once the active animal responded at a stable rate over 3 days, with every third lever press being reinforced by cocaine (FR3), it was allowed free access to cocaine (0.5 mg) for 16 h. Subsequently, all animals were exposed to 18 air puffs (10 psi) at 0, or 1, 3, 5, 7 and 14 days after the 'binge'. Immediately following the binge, there was no significant difference in the rate of startle-induced USVs between the active cocaine group and the yoked saline group. However, the yoked or non-contingent cocaine rats emitted significantly higher rates of USVs immediately after the last cocaine infusion. At the time of the peak increase in USVs, the active and yoked cocaine groups were significantly different. For up to 5 days after unlimited cocaine access, the active and passive-cocaine groups showed an increase in USVs response when compared to the yoked saline group. The emerging increase in USVs and their gradual decline observed after termination of a cocaine 'binge' can be interpreted as an abstinence phenomenon. The non-contingent cocaine appears to be highly aversive, as indicated by the immediate significant increase in the rate of USVs after termination of a cocaine 'binge'.","Withdrawal from a self-administered or non-contingent cocaine binge: differences in ultrasonic distress vocalizations in rats.","Psychopharmacology","Mutschler NH and Miczek KA","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 15:37:28,-1,2021-03-31 12:49:25,,,,,,,,

All rats were provided with continuous access to a nutritionally complete diet throughout the 6-week study. In addition, different subgroups within each age had access to an optional source of vegetable shortening under schedules in which the frequency of access was manipulated: controls (C)-- no shortening access; MWF--2-h shortening access on Monday, Wednesday and Friday; D2--2-h shortening access every day; D24--24-h shortening access every day.

Here we studied the effect of intermittent footshock stress on reinstatement of heroin seeking following different withdrawal periods (1-66 days). We also studied whether changes in corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) mRNA in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) are correlated with this reinstatement after 1 day and 6 days of heroin withdrawal. METHODS: Rats were trained to self-administer heroin (9 h/day; 0.1 mg/kg per infusion) for 10 days. Tests for extinction behavior and footshock-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking were then conducted after 1, 6, 12, 25, or 66 days of heroin withdrawal. On the test day, rats were given five to ten 60-min extinction sessions until they reached the extinction criterion of less than 15 responses per 60 min on the lever previously associated with heroin. Rats were then exposed to intermittent foot-shock (0.8 mA; 10 min), and lever-pressing behavior was recorded for 120 min. RESULTS: Reinstatement of lever-pressing behavior by footshock followed an inverted U-shaped curve with maximal responding after 6 days and 12 days of heroin withdrawal. Surprisingly, foot-shock did not reinstate lever-pressing behavior on day 1 of withdrawal. Lever pressing during extinction, prior to exposure to footshock, also followed an inverted U-shaped curve, with higher responding after 6, 12, and 25 days of heroin withdrawal. Finally, compared with control groups not exposed to shock, CRF mRNA levels in response to footshock were increased in the CeA (day 1 of withdrawal) and the dorsal BNST (day 1 and day 6), but not in the ventral BNST. CONCLUSIONS: The duration of the heroin withdrawal period is an important factor in the manifestation of (1) footshock stress-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking and (2) extinction of the heroin-reinforced behavior. Finally, the time-dependent changes in footshock stress-induced reinstatement following withdrawal from heroin were not correlated with alterations in CRF mRNA in the CeA and BNST.","Time-dependent changes in extinction behavior and stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking following withdrawal from heroin in rats.","Psychopharmacology","Shalev U and Morales M and Hope B and Yap J and Shaham Y","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 15:37:54,-1,2021-03-31 12:50:45,,,,,,,,

Recent evidence suggests that the prevalence of these disorders is rising and that the age of onset has fallen. In the present study, disturbed eating attitudes and behaviours were evaluated in a large school-based population in Ontario in order to determine their prevalence and demographic distribution. METHODS: Females, aged 12-18 years, from schools in Toronto, Hamilton and Ottawa were invited to complete questionnaires, including 3 subscales of the Eating Disorder Inventory (Drive for Thinness, Body Dissatisfaction, Bulimia), the Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26) and the Diagnostic Survey for Eating Disorders (DSED). RESULTS: Questionnaires were completed by 1739 (70%) of the 2483 adolescent females who were approached. The mean age of subjects in the sample was 14.6 (standard deviation 1.9) years. Thirteen percent of those aged 12-14 years and 16% of those aged 15-18 years had scores above the recommended cut-off (> or = 20) for disordered eating on the EAT-26. Current dieting to lose weight was reported by 23% of participants. Binge eating with associated loss of control was reported by 15% of participants, self-induced vomiting by 8.2% and the use of diet pills by 2.4%. Laxative and diuretic misuse were uncommon. Dieting was associated with an increased risk of binge-eating and purging behaviours. Older age and body mass index in the highest quartile were independently related to symptoms of eating disorders. INTERPRETATION: Disordered eating attitudes and behaviours were present in over 27% of girls aged 12-18 years and were seen to increase gradually throughout adolescence. Prevention programs to diminish the progression and impact of these disorders should be implemented and assessed.","Disordered eating attitudes and behaviours in teenaged girls: a school-based study.","CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne","Jones JM and Bennett S and Olmsted MP and Lawson ML and Rodin G","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 15:38:03,-1,2021-03-31 12:51:06,,,,,,,,

'Deprivation-effect' paradigms, whereby abstinence from a substance results in enhanced intake, are often used to measure 'craving' for drugs of abuse, such as alcohol. The present study used operant conditioning to investigate consumption of sugar after abstinence in rats selected for glucose avidity. The experimental group was trained on a fixed ratio (FR-1) schedule for 25% glucose for 30 min/day for 28 days and also had glucose access in the home cages for an additional 11.5 h daily. The control group had only the 30-min/day access to glucose in the operant chambers. Then, both groups were deprived of glucose for 2 weeks. After this period of abstinence, animals were put back in the operant chambers. The experimental group responded significantly more than ever before, and significantly more than the control group. In conclusion, daily 12-h access to sugar, in the paradigm used, can result in an altered neural state that lasts throughout 2 weeks of abstinence, leading to enhanced intake. Together with previous results, this deprivation effect supports the theory that animals may become dependent on sugar under selected dietary circumstances.","Sugar-dependent rats show enhanced responding for sugar after abstinence: evidence of a sugar deprivation effect.","Physiology & behavior","Avena NM and Long KA and Hoebel BG","",1,2021-04-01 15:54:56,1,2021-03-29 17:10:18,-1,2021-03-31 12:52:47,,,,,,,,

Withdrawal aggression was measured after the removal of a subcutaneous morphine pellet or after precipitation by naloxone in naive mice and after removal of a morphine pellet in mice with prior fighting experience. In naive mice, removal of a morphine pellet led to increases in attack bites and threats but naloxone-precipitated withdrawal led to decreases in these behaviors and to increases in defensive posturing, escape attempts and vocalizations. Prior fighting experience abolished the enhanced attack behaviors of resident mice following morphine pellet removal, but led to heightened defensive behavior in intruder mice. The behavior of intruder mice appeared more sensitive to naloxone administration than the behavior of resident mice; naloxone influenced not only intruder defensive behavior, but also other non-aggressive behaviors. The social role of the drug recipient and his prior history of aggressive behavior are important determinants of morphine and naloxone effects on aggression.","Aggression during morphine withdrawal: effects of method of withdrawal, fighting experience, and social role.","Psychopharmacology","Kantak KM and Miczek KA","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 17:10:34,-1,2021-03-31 12:54:26,,,,,,,,

Evidence for sugar addiction: Behavioral and neurochemical effects of intermittent, excessive sugar intake. Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews XX(X), XXX-XXX]. The experimental question is whether or not sugar can be a substance of abuse and lead to a natural form of addiction. 'Food addiction' seems plausible because brain pathways that evolved to respond to natural rewards are also activated by addictive drugs. Sugar is noteworthy as a substance that releases opioids and dopamine and thus might be expected to have addictive potential. This review summarizes evidence of sugar dependence in an animal model. Four components of addiction are analyzed. 'Bingeing,' 'withdrawal,' 'craving' and 'cross-sensitization' are each given operational definitions and demonstrated behaviorally with sugar bingeing as the reinforcer. These behaviors are then related to neurochemical changes in the brain that also occur with addictive drugs. Neural adaptations include changes in dopamine and opioid receptor binding, enkephalin mRNA expression and dopamine and acetylcholine release in the nucleus accumbens. The evidence supports the hypothesis that under certain circumstances rats can become sugar dependent. This may translate to some human conditions as suggested by the literature on eating disorders and obesity.","Evidence for sugar addiction: behavioral and neurochemical effects of intermittent, excessive sugar intake.","Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews","Avena NM and Rada P and Hoebel BG","non-experimental study,non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 17:10:45,-1,2021-03-31 12:54:53,,,,,,,,

Stimulation of hippocampal input to the accumbens activates GABAergic output to the subpallidal area which leads to suppression of spontaneous firing of subpallidal neurons, while activation of dopamine receptors in the accumbens suppresses GABAergic output to subpallidal area and thus increases the firing of picrotoxin-sensitive ventral pallidal neurons. However, both treatments induced hypermotility suggesting the functional heterogeneity of the ventral and subpallidal areas in 'limbic-motor integration'. Furthermore, both hippocampal output signals and dopaminergic input to the accumbens descend via ventral and subpallidal areas serially to the pedunculopontine nucleus, the region of the mesencephalic locomotor region. In addition, a parallel ascending pathway from the subpallidal area to the mediodorsal nucleus, and subsequently to the medial prefrontal cortex, probably mediates behaviour, e.g. food hoarding, that requires higher cognitive processing.","The contribution of basal forebrain to limbic-motor integration and the mediation of motivation to action.","Advances in experimental medicine and biology","Mogenson GJ and Yang CR","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 17:11:28,-1,2021-03-31 12:57:07,,,,,,,,

Such differences may be a result of the assay methods used or the way results are compared with those from normal controls. To investigate these possibilities, we analyzed serum leptin levels in anorexic, bulimic, obese, and control individuals, thereby spanning the full range of human body weights, using three frequently employed commercial kits. Kits from Linco (St Louis, MO) and DSL (Webster, TX) employ a radioimmunoassay method, and the R&D Systems kit (Minneapolis, MN) uses an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We found that the three kits provide results that are highly linearly correlated with each other and remarkably linearly related to percent ideal body weight (%IBW) over more than three orders of magnitude (Linco, r = 0.90; R&D, r = 0.87; DSL, r = 0.86). For very low leptin levels, the more sensitive kits from R&D and Linco appeared to give more reliable results. Measurement method does not appear to explain the literature conflicts. We found that patients with anorexia nervosa have serum leptin values that lie above the line extrapolated from the %IBW/leptin curve generated from analysis of all non-anorexic patients. Therefore, in anorexia nervosa, inappropriately high leptin levels for %IBW may contribute to a blunted physiologic response to underweight and consequent resistance to dietary treatment. By contrast, most bulimic patients have leptin levels significantly below those predicted from the same %IBW/leptin curve. The relative leptin deficiency in bulimic subjects may contribute to food-craving behavior. We propose that using the %IBW/ leptin curve can facilitate identification of true pathophysiologic abnormalities in eating-disordered individuals and provide a basis for the design of therapeutic interventions or monitoring of response to treatment.","Leptin in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa: importance of assay technique and method of interpretation.","The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine","Frederich R and Hu S and Raymond N and Pomeroy C","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 17:11:53,-1,2021-03-31 12:58:27,,,,,,,,

CONCLUSIONS: The higher rates of psychological, physical, and multiple abuse found among women with a lifetime history of bulimia nervosa than among comparison subjects underscore the importance of examining the full range of possible abusive experiences in women with eating disorders, rather than focusing simply on sexual abuse.","Childhood sexual, physical, and psychological abuse in bulimia nervosa.","The American journal of psychiatry","Rorty M and Yager J and Rossotto E","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 17:12:01,-1,2021-03-31 12:58:36,,,,,,,,

The question is why. As with the withdrawal from morphine, nicotine, diazepam and sugar, the ethanol withdrawal state may involve an increase in nucleus accumbens (NAc) acetylcholine (ACh) causing an alteration of the dopamine (DA)-ACh balance in favor of ACh. Therefore the effects of acute and chronic alcohol (1 gm/kg/day i.p.) treatment on extracellular concentrations of NAc ACh and DA were determined before and after naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. Ethanol initially increased DA to 119% of baseline as measured by microdialysis. This was still the case on the 21st day of ethanol injection when DA increased to 126%. There was no effect of ethanol on ACh. However, naloxone (3 mg/kg s.c.) injected the next day decreased extracellular DA to 83% of baseline and caused a significant rise in ACh to 119%.

Studies of the effects of dopaminergic lesions and dopamine receptor blockade indicate that intravenous heroin self-administration depends importantly on a dopaminergic substrate. Mapping of effective injection sites for morphine-conditioned place preference establishes one site of rewarding action near the dopamine cell bodies of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Studies of the complex interactions of opiates, neuroleptics, and brain stimulation reward confirm that reward-related VTA opioid actions are dopamine-dependent. Opioid injections into the nucleus accumbens (NAS) also facilitate brain stimulation reward and serve as rewards in their own right, though these actions have not yet been localized by identification of negative sites in surrounding regions. The relation of this putative reward site to the dopamine system is not yet clear. Suggestions that the lateral hypothalamus or periaqueductal gray contain opioid reward sites remain to be confirmed. While opioid injections into these sites can be rewarding, these rewarding effects have not been localized to these sites, and opiate injections into each of these areas are reported not to facilitate brain stimulation reward. Intravenous heroin self-administration is not disrupted by kainic acid lesions of the bed nucleus of the lateral hypothalamus. Thus only the VTA and the NAS are firmly established as sites of opiate rewarding actions. Recent reports suggest that the kappa-opioid dynorphin may also have central rewarding actions and central and peripheral aversive actions; the CA3 region of the hippocampus is a possible site of the rewarding action.","Opiate reward: sites and substrates.","Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews","Wise RA","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 17:13:44,-1,2021-03-31 12:59:04,,,,,,,,

In more theoretical terms, drug craving can be conceptualized within the framework of incentive motivational theories of behavior and be defined as the incentive motivation to self-administer a psychoactive substance. The incentive-motivational value of drugs is hypothesized to be determined by a continuous interaction between the hedonic rewarding properties of drugs (incentive) and the motivational state of the organism (organismic state). In drug-dependent individuals, the incentive-motivational value of drugs (i.e., drug craving) is greater compared to non-drug-dependent individuals due to the motivational state (i.e., withdrawal) developed with repeated drug administration. In this conceptual framework, animal models of drug craving would reflect two aspects of the incentive motivation to self-administer a psychoactive substance. One aspect would be the unconditioned incentive (reinforcing) value of the drug itself. The other aspect would be relatively independent of the direct (unconditioned) incentive value of the drug itself and could be reflected in the ability of previously neutral stimuli to acquire conditioned incentive properties that could elicit drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior. Animal models of drug craving that permit the investigation of the behavioral and neurobiological components of these two aspects of drug craving are reviewed and evaluated. The models reviewed are the progressive ratio, choice, extinction, conditioned reinforcement and second-order schedule paradigms. These animal models are evaluated according to two criteria that are established herein as necessary and sufficient criteria for the evaluation of animal models of human psychopathology: reliability and predictive validity.

We examined the association between baseline and change in consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks (the independent variables), and difference in measures of obesity, with linear and logistic regression analyses adjusted for potentially confounding variables and clustering of results within schools. FINDINGS: For each additional serving of sugar-sweetened drink consumed, both body mass index (BMI) (mean 0.24 kg/m2; 95% CI 0.10-0.39; p=0.03) and frequency of obesity (odds ratio 1.60; 95% CI 1.14-2.24; p=0.02) increased after adjustment for anthropometric, demographic, dietary, and lifestyle variables.

Clinical reports have led to the suggestion that some individuals may develop addictive-like behaviors when consuming palatable foods. Binge eating is a behavioral component of bulimia and obesity and has also become increasingly common in nonclinical populations in our society. This review summarizes the behavioral and neurochemical similarities between binge eating of palatable foods and the administration of drugs of abuse. An animal model of bingeing on sugar is used to illustrate behaviors found with some drugs of abuse, such as opiate-like withdrawal signs, enhanced intake following abstinence, and cross-sensitization. Related neurochemical changes commonly observed with drugs of abuse, including changes in dopamine and acetylcholine release in the nucleus accumbens, can also be found with bingeing on sugar. These neurochemical alterations are exacerbated when animals binge on sugar while at a low body weight or when the food they ingest is purged. Drawing on other animal models and the clinical literature, parallels between drug abuse and binge-eating behavior are discussed.","Examining the addictive-like properties of binge eating using an animal model of sugar dependence.","Experimental and clinical psychopharmacology","Avena NM","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 17:14:10,-1,2021-03-31 12:59:19,,,,,,,,

Male, adult rats implanted with a chronic cannula aimed at this nucleus were tested for self-administration in a rectangular chamber equipped with two levers, one at each end. Each subject was given several sessions in blocks of two sessions for a given substance, the first session with the active lever at one end of the chamber, the next with the active lever at the other end. During a session, responses on the inactive lever were without consequences. Depression of the active lever was coupled with the presentation of a tone to facilitate discrimination between the two levers. All subjects received a sequence of 5 sessions, the first for habituation, the next two to test for effects of artificial cerebrospinal fluid, and the next two to test for effects of morphine. A few subjects in which the cannula had not been dislodged or plugged were further tested for effects of morphine and then for effects of morphine mixed with naloxone. Each response on the active lever resulted in an injection of 0.02 microliter. During the morphine sessions, this volume contained 0.2 microgram of the opiate; during the sessions of morphine and naloxone, this volume contained 0.2 microgram morphine mixed with 0.2 microgram naloxone. The results show that self-administration was induced and maintained when morphine was injected inside the nucleus accumbens, not in an area outside this region but at the same brain level. The rate or responding on the active lever for morphine was higher than for artificial cerebrospinal fluid and it showed a pattern of gradual increase over time. In contrast, the rate of responding on the inactive lever during the morphine sessions showed a decline. This pattern was not evident in these animals during control sessions and in the animals in which the injections were outside the n. accumbens. These results are interpreted to indicate that the n. accumbens may be part of a system of structures mediating the reinforcing effects of opiates.","Reinforcing effects of morphine in the nucleus accumbens.","Brain research","Olds ME","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 17:14:31,-1,2021-03-31 12:59:34,,,,,,,,

Successful analysis of the controls of meal size is a fundamental goal of the science of ingestion. This paper proposes a new classification of the controls of meal size based on an unambiguous physical criterion. The criterion is food stimuli contacting preabsorptive receptors along the surface of the gut from the tip of the tongue to the end of the small intestine. Direct controls depend upon such contact. Indirect controls, e.g., rhythmic metabolic, cognitive, etc., do not have such contact. Instead, indirect controls change meal size by modulating the potency of direct controls. A method of measuring the potency of direct and indirect controls is described. The classification is unambiguous, comprehensive, and explicates the functional relationship between indirect and direct controls. Because the method of measurement is quantitative, this classification is heuristic foe mechanistic research and provides a common theoretical framework for diverse investigators interested in different aspects of the controls of eating and meal size.","The direct and indirect controls of meal size.","Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews","Smith GP","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 17:14:50,-1,2021-03-31 13:00:07,,,,,,,,

Eating more than intended is also a prominent feature both of obese people who are trying to lose weight and normal weight women who are attempting to restrict their food intake. Overeating tends to be triggered by a specific set of cues, which commonly involve either mood disturbances or exposure to 'forbidden' food, but may include other environmental cues. It is argued that conditioning processes are relevant both to the establishment of meal patterns in normal subjects and in the maintenance of excessive eating. Treatment procedures have typically followed the general approach of 'Self Management' which emphasises reducing exposure to the cues associated with eating. An alternative approach derives from the idea that the association between eating responses (or urges to eat) and external cues may be learned, and therefore should in principle be ameanable to extinction through systematic unreinforced exposure.

The rats were either food restricted (dieting) or not restricted and refed regular or palatable food (binging). RESULTS: Thirty days after normalization (full feeding, no restriction cycling), rats with a history of cycles of restriction and hyperphagia continued to exhibit persistent binge eating.

We also evaluated the validity of the equal environment assumption (EEA) with reference to these two phenotypes. METHODS: We interviewed 1897 female twins (including both members of 854 twin pairs) from a population-based register about their lifetime history of binge-eating and of broadly defined BN twice, approximately 5 years apart. RESULTS: The reliabilities of a lifetime history of binge-eating (kappa = .34) and of broadly defined BN (kappa = .28) were low. Based on single interviews, the heritability of binge-eating was estimated to be 50% and broad BN 60%, with the remaining variance attributable to individual-specific environment. Common environmental influences had no effect on liability to either trait. By combining information from two interview waves and thereby incorporating error of measurement into a structural equation model, the estimated heritability of the latent vulnerability to binge-eating (82%) and broadly defined BN (83%) increased substantially. Although there were no violations of the EEA detected for binge-eating, cosocialization influenced twin concordance for broadly defined BN.

In order to elucidate the activity of the endogenous prodynorphin system during opiate tolerance and dependence, we investigated the effect of single and repeated morphine administration on the alpha-neoendorphin tissue level, its in vitro release, and the prodynorphin messenger RNA level in the nucleus accumbens and striatum of the rat. Acute and repeated morphine administration (14 days, increasing doses, 20-100 mg/kg, i.p.) increased the level of alpha-neoendorphin in the nucleus accumbens after 3 h; a similar effect was observed at 24 and 48 h after the last chronic morphine injection. On the other hand, the basal and stimulated (K+, 57 mM) release of alpha-neoendorphin from nucleus accumbens slices were significantly elevated only at 24 h after the last morphine injection. The prodynorphin messenger RNA hybridization signal in the nucleus accumbens was enhanced at 3 h after acute morphine injection, whereas repeated morphine administration decreased the messenger RNA level at that time point. Upon late chronic morphine withdrawal (at 24 and 48 h), the prodynorphin messenger RNA level in that tissue was significantly elevated. In the striatum, single morphine administration had no effect on the alpha-neoendorphin tissue level, release of the peptide, and prodynorphin messenger RNA level. On the other hand, chronic injection of morphine elevated all those parameters. The tissue level of alpha-neoendorphin was elevated at 3 h, and was back to normal at 24 and 48 h after the last drug injection. Both the basal and stimulated alpha-neoendorphin release from striatal slices was significantly increased at all the time points studied. Repeated morphine administration elevated the striatal prodynorphin messenger RNA level at 24 and 48 h after the drug withdrawal. Addition of morphine to the incubation medium reduced the basal release of alpha-neoendorphin in both the nucleus accumbens and striatal slices in naive animals, whereas the stimulated release was attenuated in the latter tissue only. The present study indicates that withdrawal of chronic morphine leads to enhancement of the prodynorphin neurons activity in the nucleus accumbens and striatum of the rat. It is suggested that these effects may participate in the mechanism of aversive reactions during withdrawal.","The effect of single and repeated morphine administration on the prodynorphin system activity in the nucleus accumbens and striatum of the rat.","Neuroscience","Przewlocka B and Turchan J and Lason W and Przewlocki R","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 17:15:56,-1,2021-03-31 13:03:55,,,,,,,,

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Participants were 71 healthy women volunteers enrolled in a university-based nurse practitioner program. Predictors of change in BMI were hypothesized to be cortisol secretion, dietary restraint, binging, mastery, mood, and eating attitudes. Measures were made at the beginning of the academic semester and 12 weeks later during the participants' examination period. RESULTS: The women were of normal weight (BMI 25.2 +/- 4.3) for their age [43; standard deviation (SD), 7]. By the examination period, 40 had gained weight (mean, 5.5 pounds; SD, 2.2), 19 lost weight (mean, 2.5 pounds; SD, 1.5), and 12 had stable weight. BMI, salivary cortisol secretion, binging behavior, depression, and anxiety increased significantly, whereas scores on dietary restraint, weight, shape, and eating concerns, and mastery decreased significantly. Regression analysis showed that change in daily cortisol secretion significantly predicted change in BMI and that mastery significantly moderated this relationship. However, a reduction in dietary restraint was a perfect mediator of this relationship. Change in cortisol secretion also significantly predicted change in dietary restraint, and this was moderated by dietary restraint at the beginning of the academic semester. Reduction in dietary restraint was also predicted by a reduction in mastery and weight concern. DISCUSSION: We identified individual differences that confer vulnerability to weight gain during stressful life events (dietary restraint and mastery). Given that women are exposed to daily stressors and use cognitive strategies to restrain their dietary intake, increasing awareness of the role of stress on eating behavior and weight is an important goal.","The effects of stress on body weight: biological and psychological predictors of change in BMI.","Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)","Roberts C and Troop N and Connan F and Treasure J and Campbell IC","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 17:16:03,-1,2021-03-31 13:03:59,,,,,,,,

These data suggest that the well-documented ability of small doses of morphine to increase rats' intake of ethanol is probably not related to its ability to produce gastrointestinal effects, but rather due to its ability to modulate central motivational mechanisms associated with ingestion.","A small dose of morphine leads rats to drink more alcohol and achieve higher blood alcohol concentrations.","Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research","Hubbell CL and Mankes RF and Reid LD","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 17:16:23,-1,2021-03-31 13:04:05,,,,,,,,

This hypothesis has been supported by several lines of evidence, including previous 'taste reactivity' studies of the influence of systemic morphine on affective (hedonic and aversive) behavioral reactions to taste palatability. The presents study examined whether opioid agonists enhance palatability by acting centrally on brain palatability systems. Here we report the effect of intraventricular microinjections of morphine (0, 12, 25, 50 nmols) on hedonic taste reactions to a 0.12 M sucrose solution. The effect on feeding was also assessed in order to determine whether feeding and palatability enhancement are linked, as would be required by the hypothesis that feeding is due to enhanced palatability. Both hedonic taste reactivity patterns and feeding were significantly increased together by morphine administration into the lateral ventricle. We conclude that opioid-induced enhancement of the hedonic palatability of food is a centrally mediated effect. Enhancement of food palatability may be an important psychological route by which intracranial administration of opioid agonists induce feeding.","Central enhancement of taste pleasure by intraventricular morphine.","Neurobiology (Budapest, Hungary)","Pecina S and Berridge KC","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 17:16:36,-1,2021-03-31 13:04:10,,,,,,,,

The efficacy of restricting children's access to palatable foods as a means of promoting patterns of moderate intake of those foods is unknown. OBJECTIVE: Two experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that restricting access to a palatable food enhances children's subsequent behavioral responses to, selection of, and intake of that restricted food. DESIGN: Both experiments used a within-subjects design to examine the effects of restricting access to a palatable food on children's subsequent behavior, food selection, and food intake. The first experiment examined the effects of restriction within and outside the restricted context and the second experiment focused on the effects within the restricted context. RESULTS: In both experiments, restricting access to a palatable food increased children's behavioral response to that food. Experiment 2 showed that restricting access increased children's subsequent selection and intake of that food within the restricted context. CONCLUSIONS: Restricting access focuses children's attention on restricted foods, while increasing their desire to obtain and consume those foods. Restricting children's access to palatable foods is not an effective means of promoting moderate intake of palatable foods and may encourage the intake of foods that should be limited in the diet.","Restricting access to palatable foods affects children's behavioral response, food selection, and intake.","The American journal of clinical nutrition","Fisher JO and Birch LL","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 17:16:43,-1,2021-03-31 13:04:20,,,,,,,,

Because palatable food stimulates neural systems that are implicated in drug addiction, it was hypothesized that intermittent, excessive sugar intake might create dependency, as indicated by withdrawal signs. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Male rats were food-deprived for 12 hours daily, including 4 hours in the early dark, and then offered highly palatable 25% glucose in addition to chow for the next 12 hours. Withdrawal was induced by naloxone or food deprivation. Withdrawal signs were measured by observation, ultrasonic recordings, elevated plus maze tests, and in vivo microdialysis. RESULTS: Naloxone (20 mg/kg intraperitoneally) caused somatic signs, such as teeth chattering, forepaw tremor, and head shakes. Food deprivation for 24 hours caused spontaneous withdrawal signs, such as teeth chattering. Naloxone (3 mg/kg subcutaneously) caused reduced time on the exposed arm of an elevated plus maze, where again significant teeth chattering was recorded. The plus maze anxiety effect was replicated with four control groups for comparison. Accumbens microdialysis revealed that naloxone (10 and 20 mg/kg intraperitoneally) decreased extracellular dopamine (DA), while dose-dependently increasing acetylcholine (ACh). The naloxone-induced DA/ACh imbalance was replicated with 10% sucrose and 3 mg/kg naloxone subcutaneously. DISCUSSION: Repeated, excessive intake of sugar created a state in which an opioid antagonist caused behavioral and neurochemical signs of opioid withdrawal. The indices of anxiety and DA/ACh imbalance were qualitatively similar to withdrawal from morphine or nicotine, suggesting that the rats had become sugar-dependent.","Evidence that intermittent, excessive sugar intake causes endogenous opioid dependence.","Obesity research","Colantuoni C and Rada P and McCarthy J and Patten C and Avena NM and Chadeayne A and Hoebel BG","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc)",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 17:16:57,-1,2021-03-31 13:04:37,,,,,,,,

Exposing animals to this drug either systemically or in the cell body region of these neurons in the ventral tegmental area leads to long-lasting alterations in dopaminergic function. These have most often been assessed as increased locomotor activity and enhanced DA overflow in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) after re-exposure to the drug weeks to months later. Evidence is presented showing that manipulations that produce this sensitization of midbrain DA neuron reactivity enhance the pursuit and self-administration of psychostimulant drugs. Procedures known to prevent the induction of sensitization by amphetamine also prevent the facilitation of drug taking. Enhanced drug self-administration and primed reinstatement of drug seeking are also accompanied by enhanced NAcc DA reactivity. Finally, drugs that increase NAcc DA overflow acutely but fail to produce sensitization of this effect are not associated with the subsequent enhancement of self-administration. These results indicate a direct relationship between the sensitization of midbrain dopamine neuron reactivity and the excessive pursuit and self-administration of psychostimulant drugs. Understanding the neuronal events and adaptations that underlie the induction and expression of sensitization may thus help elucidate how drug abuse develops, how it is reinstated and ultimately how both may be prevented.","Sensitization of midbrain dopamine neuron reactivity and the self-administration of psychomotor stimulant drugs.","Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews","Vezina P","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 17:17:49,-1,2021-03-31 13:08:53,,,,,,,,

Rats made significantly fewer entries into the open arms than into the closed arms, and spent significantly less time in open arms.

Cannabinoids activate ventral tegmental area dopaminergic neurons, the main ascending projections of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system, and change their spiking pattern by increasing the number of impulses in a burst and elevating the frequency of bursts. Although they also increase time-averaged striatal dopamine levels for extended periods of time, little is known about the temporal structure of this change. To elucidate this, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry was used to monitor extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens of freely moving rats with subsecond timescale resolution. Intravenous administration of the central cannabinoid (CB1) receptor agonist, R(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[(morpholinyl)methyl]pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazi n-6-yl]-(1-naphthalenyl) methanone mesylate, dose-dependently produced catalepsy, decreased locomotion, and reduced the amplitude of electrically evoked dopamine release while markedly increasing the frequency of detected (nonstimulated) dopamine concentration transients. The CB1 receptor antagonist [N-piperidino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methylpyrazole-3-carbox amide] reversed and prevented all agonist-induced effects but did not show effects on dopamine release when injected alone.

Palatable food also releases accumbens-shell DA, but in naive rats the effect can wane during a long meal and disappears with repetition. Under select dietary circumstances, sugar can have effects similar to a drug of abuse. Rats show signs of DA sensitization and opioid dependence when given intermittent access to sucrose, such as alterations in DA and mu-opioid receptors, cross-sensitization with amphetamine and alcohol, and behavioral and neurochemical signs of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. The present experiment asks whether sucrose-dependent rats release DA each time they binge. We also predict that acetylcholine (ACh), which rises as the end of a meal, will be delayed in rats with intermittent access to sucrose. To create dependency, the experimental group (Daily Intermittent Sucrose) was maintained on a diet of 12-h food deprivation that extended 4 h into the dark, followed by 12-h access to a 10% sucrose solution and chow, daily, for 21 days. As the main result, these rats gradually increased their sucrose intake from 37 to 112 ml per day (from 13 to 20 ml in the first hour of access), and repeatedly increased extracellular DA to 130% of baseline as measured in the NAc shell by microdialysis during the first hour of sucrose access on day 1, day 2 and day 21. Three control groups failed to show a significant increase in extracellular DA on day 21: Sucrose only for 1 h on days 1 and 21 (Sucrose Twice), ad libitum access to sucrose and chow (Daily Ad libitum Sucrose), and intermittent chow instead of sucrose (Daily Intermittent Chow). Acetylcholine measured at the same time as DA, increased significantly toward the end and after each test meal in all groups. In the Daily Intermittent Sucrose group, the highest ACh levels (133%) occurred during the first sample after the sucrose meal ended. In summary, sucrose-dependent animals have a delayed ACh satiation response, drink more sucrose, and release more DA than sucrose- or binge-experienced, but non-dependent animals. These results suggest another neurochemical similarity between intermittent bingeing on sucrose and drugs of abuse: both can repeatedly increase extracellular DA in the NAc shell.","Daily bingeing on sugar repeatedly releases dopamine in the accumbens shell.","Neuroscience","Rada P and Avena NM and Hoebel BG","",-1,2021-04-01 15:58:16,1,2021-03-29 17:19:41,-1,2021-03-31 13:10:28,,,,,,,,

The present study used microdialysis to monitor extracellular acetylcholine levels in the accumbens, fluorescent labeled toxins to monitor changes in acetylcholinesterase and muscarinic-1 receptors, and semiquantitative-polymerase chain reaction to detect changes in gene expression for the muscarinic-1 receptor. Microdialysis showed that acetylcholine levels did not change while an animal was swimming; however, a significant transient decrease occurred when the rat was returned to the dialysis cage, followed by a long-lasting increase that reached a maximum three hours after the test. Acetylcholine levels stayed high even 24 h after the initial test as evidenced by a significant elevation in basal level prior to the second swim.

RESULTS: A greater proportion of women with AN-B/P and BN reported use of each product, compared with women with AN-R and control participants. Among product users, patients with eating disorders reported using greater amounts than controls. Among patients who reported binge eating and/or purging, the quantity of each product used was inversely correlated with body mass index (BMI).

The relative reinforcing value of snack foods was assessed in binge eaters and non-binge eaters across a stress-induction session (after 3-minutes of anticipation of giving a speech) or a control day (after 3-minutes of reading magazines), with order of conditions counterbalanced. Subjects were divided into four groups based on scores on the Binge Eating Scale (BES) and changes in perceived stress: Binge eaters/low stress reactivity (n=12), binge eaters/high stress reactivity (n=10), non-binge eaters/low stress reactivity (n=6), non-binge eaters/high stress reactivity (n=9). Dietary restraint, hunger, disinhibition, and hedonics were measured by self-report. Body composition was estimated by body mass index (BMI=weight in kilograms divided by height in metres squared). The relative reinforcing value of snack food was influenced differently by binge status and stress reactivity in the stress and control conditions (p<0.05). Binge eaters who reacted to stress earned more snack food points (p<0.001) in stress condition, but non-binge eaters who showed high stress reactivity earned less points for snack food in stress condition (p<0.05). This same pattern of results remained after statistically controlling for body mass index (BMI) and dietary restraint. Findings suggest that reactivity to interpersonal or ego-related stress increases the relative reinforcing value of food in binge eaters but decreases the relative reinforcing value of snack food in non-binge eaters, and these findings appear to be independent of dietary restraint and BMI.","Stress and the relative reinforcing value of food in female binge eaters.","Physiology & behavior","Goldfield GS and Adamo KB and Rutherford J and Legg C","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 17:21:10,-1,2021-03-31 13:11:28,,,,,,,,

Fat is another constituent of foods that is inherently preferred by humans and rodents. We examined the affect of sham feeding corn oil in rats that were food and water deprived overnight. Rats were implanted with guide cannulas aimed at the NAc, as well as gastric fistulas. On alternate days, they were trained to sham lick 100% corn oil or distilled water (dH2O) for 20 min in the morning. Twenty-minute microdialysis samples were taken before, during, and after sham licking. DA and monoamines were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC with coulometric detection. The results show that DA release in the NAc was significantly increased during sham licking of corn oil compared with the prior baseline (157.5+/-18.8%, n=12). During sham licking of dH2O, DA release in the NAc was not changed (93.0+/-4.0%, n=15). This experiment demonstrates that sham feeding of corn oil releases accumbens DA in a manner similar to ingestion of sucrose. Although both stimuli may have an olfactory component, sucrose is a gustatory, and 100% corn oil appears to be a trigeminal stimulus.

METHODS: A heuristic framework of neuroadaptive changes within key brain neurocircuitry responsible for different stages of the addiction cycle is outlined and linked to human studies to provide important future translational links for diagnosis. RESULTS: Animal studies have revealed dysregulation of specific neurochemical mechanisms (dopamine, opioid peptides) in the brain reward systems and recruitment of brain stress systems (corticotropin-releasing factor) during the development of dependence that convey vulnerability to relapse. Animal studies have implicated the prefrontal cortex and basolateral amygdala in drug- and cue-induced relapse, respectively, and the brain stress systems in stress-induced relapse. Genetic studies suggest roles for the genes encoding the neurochemical elements involved in both the brain reward and stress systems in the vulnerability to addiction, and molecular studies have identified transduction and transcription factors that may mediate dependence-induced reward dysregulation. Human imaging studies reveal similar neurocircuits involved in acute intoxication, chronic drug dependence and vulnerability to relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Major neurobiological changes in substance abuse disorders common to human and animal studies relevant for diagnosis include a compromised reward system, overactivated brain stress systems and compromised orbitofrontal/prefrontal cortex function. No biological markers of substance abuse disorders currently exist, but there are many promising neurobiological features of substance abuse disorders that will eventually aid in the specific diagnoses of substance use, misuse and dependence.","The neurobiology of addiction: a neuroadaptational view relevant for diagnosis.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)","Koob GF","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 17:21:31,-1,2021-03-31 13:11:34,,,,,,,,

We developed an animal model of binge eating in sated rats that is evoked by stress, but only in rats with a history of caloric restriction and only if highly palatable food (HPF) is available after stress. This study investigated the effect of known binge triggers, a taste of HPF and of hunger, on this type of binge eating. METHOD: Female rats were cycled through the R/S protocol but this time were given just a taste of HPF with ad lib regular chow. After another R/S cycle, rats were stressed during restriction (while hungry) and were given HPF and chow. RESULTS: Although binge eating did not occur if only chow was available after stress, just a taste of HPF sufficed to increase chow intake to more than 160% (p < 0.001) of rats with a history of restriction only, stress-only, or neither. Hunger increased the proportion of chow consumed by both restricted groups, but stress magnified this hunger-induced overeating by increasing HPF intake to 137% of restriction-only rats (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: These effects suggest that binge eating in this model is motivated by reward, not metabolic need, and parallels observations of binge triggers described in clinical binge-eating disorders. This strengthens the validity of using this animal model to target the physiology and treatment of eating disorders preceded by dieting and stress.","The role of palatable food and hunger as trigger factors in an animal model of stress induced binge eating.","The International journal of eating disorders","Hagan MM and Chandler PC and Wauford PK and Rybak RJ and Oswald KD","drug, optogenetic or comoribities at the time of intermittent protocol",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 17:21:55,-1,2021-03-31 13:12:04,,,,,,,,

This study evaluated retrospective reports from 30 women participating in a BED treatment study. Although the majority of subjects in this adult sample were obese, initiation of binge eating behavior usually occurred during adolescence at a time when most subjects reported being of normal weight. Obesity developed several years after the age of onset of meeting BED criteria. Onset of binge eating usually predated that of dieting or major depressive disorder in the majority of subjects.

METHOD: The nutrient intake of 50 women with BN was analyzed from 14 day dietary records. The data were compared to the median intakes of a random sample of women and to the RDA. Clinical variables for the women with BN were also available. RESULTS: Compared to nonbinge episodes per day, binge eating was significantly higher in energy from sucrose, fat, saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and lower in protein. Compared to the population median, binge eating was significantly lower in percent energy from protein, and higher in percent carbohydrate (CHO), sucrose, SFA, and MUFA, while nonbinge eating was significantly lower in percent energy from fat, SFA, and MUFA. Total intakes were significantly higher in energy and percent energy sucrose compared to the population. Despite significantly lower nonbinge energy intake, calcium, vitamins A and C, iron, and folate were not significantly different to the population median. However, one half or more of the subjects had less than two-thirds the RDA for nonbinge calcium, iron, zinc and for total intake one fourth remained less than two-thirds the RDA for iron and zinc. CONCLUSION: Nonbinge eating was characterized by low energy intake and by low intake of iron, calcium, and zinc. Binge eating, characterized by high sucrose and SFA content, overcompensated for these low energy intakes. Where treatment reduces or eliminates binge eating, it should also encourage consumption of regular meals and in particular, consumption of foods rich in zinc and iron.","The nutrient intake of women with bulimia nervosa.","The International journal of eating disorders","Gendall KA and Sullivan PE and Joyce PR and Carter FA and Bulik CM","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 17:22:38,-1,2021-03-31 13:13:05,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the impact of early life experiences on appetitive responses. The present investigation assessed the effects of brief handling/separation or protracted separation from the dams, on feeding and anxiety responses during development. During the first 3 weeks post-partum, Sprague-Dawley rat pups were exposed daily to either brief (15 min) handling/isolation (H), a more protracted (3 h) period of maternal separation (MS), or were not handled (NH). When tested on the elevated plus-maze (at 5-6 weeks) H groups displayed less anxiety than NH gender-matched controls. Surprisingly, so did the MS females. At weaning (Day 22), the MS rats weighed significantly less than both the H and NH animals; the difference between the H and MS was more robust and persisted throughout the experiment (D 62). The H animals of both genders, and the females of the MS group, consumed more of the palatable 'snack' than their NH counterparts. The feeding suppressant response to the various satiety peptides (bombesin, cholecystokinin, and amylin) was not affected by the early life experience, with exception of cholecystokinin (CCK) effects, which were more pronounced in H and MS males.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Daily diary reports of between-meal snacking, fruit and vegetable consumption and perceived variations in daily food intake. RESULTS: The results showed daily hassles were associated with increased consumption of high fat/sugar snacks and with a reduction in main meals and vegetable consumption. Ego-threatening, interpersonal and work-related hassles were associated with increased snacking, whereas, physical stressors were associated with decreased snacking. The overall hassles-snacking relationship was significantly stronger and more positive at high compared to low levels of restraint, emotional eating, disinhibition, external eating and in females and obese participants. Simultaneous consideration of these moderators indicated that emotional eating was the pre-eminent moderator of the hassles-snacking relationship.

Drugs abused by humans (e.g., opiates, ethanol, nicotine, amphetamine, and cocaine) increased extracellular dopamine concentrations in both areas, but especially in the accumbens, and elicited hypermotility at low doses. On the other hand, drugs with aversive properties (e.g., agonists of kappa opioid receptors, U-50,488, tifluadom, and bremazocine) reduced dopamine release in the accumbens and in the caudate and elicited hypomotility. Haloperidol, a neuroleptic drug, increased extracellular dopamine concentrations, but this effect was not preferential for the accumbens and was associated with hypomotility and sedation. Drugs not abused by humans [e.g., imipramine (an antidepressant), atropine (an antimuscarinic drug), and diphenhydramine (an antihistamine)] failed to modify synaptic dopamine concentrations.

Incubation of reward craving is not drug specific: sucrose seeking induced by re-exposure to the reward cues also increases after withdrawal, but for a time period that is shorter than that of cocaine. 3. Incubation of cocaine craving is not evident after acute re-exposure to cocaine itself: cocaine seeking induced by cocaine priming injections remains essentially unchanged over the first 6 months of withdrawal. 4.

These factors were reported to contribute to relapse to drug use in humans following prolonged abstinence periods. In the reinstatement model, the ability of acute exposure to drug or nondrug stimuli to reinstate drug seeking is determined following training for drug self-administration and subsequent extinction of the drug-reinforced behavior. We will review studies in which pharmacological agents were injected systemically or intracranially to block (or mimic) reinstatement by drug priming, drug cues, and stressors. We also will review studies in which brain lesions, in vivo microdialysis and electrochemistry, and gene expression methods were used to map brain sites involved in relapse to drug seeking. Subsequently, we will discuss theoretical issues related to the processes underlying relapse to drugs and address methodological issues in studies on reinstatement of drug seeking. Finally, the implications of the findings from the studies reviewed for addiction theories and treatment will be discussed. The main conclusion of this review is that the neuronal mechanisms involved in relapse to heroin and cocaine seeking induced by drug priming, drug cues, and stressors are to a large degree dissociable.

In microdialysis tests during the first sugar meal on days 1, 2 and 21, extracellular dopamine increased at least 30% each day in both groups. Acetylcholine also increased during the sugar meals for the real-feeding animals, but not during sham feeding. In conclusion, the taste of sugar can increase extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens without fail in animals on a dietary regimen that causes bingeing and sugar dependency. During sham feeding, the acetylcholine satiation signal is eliminated, and the animals drink more. These findings support the hypothesis that dopamine is released repeatedly in response to taste when bingeing on sweet food, and the acetylcholine satiety effect is greatly reduced by purging; this may be relevant to bulimia nervosa in humans.","Sucrose sham feeding on a binge schedule releases accumbens dopamine repeatedly and eliminates the acetylcholine satiety response.","Neuroscience","Avena NM and Rada P and Moise N and Hoebel BG","drug, optogenetic or comoribities at the time of intermittent protocol",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 17:25:03,-1,2021-04-01 15:22:12,,,,,,,,

In a conditioned place preference paradigm, rats received injections of DALA (1.0, 3.0, or 8.0 micrograms), thiorphan (60 micrograms), and/or naloxone (10 micrograms), or saline vehicle. Conditioned reinforcement was obtained with 8.0 micrograms of DALA and also with thiorphan but not with thiorphan plus naloxone. This suggests that reward can be generated by endogenous opiates in the VTA. Tests during the light phase and dark phase suggested that diurnal periodicity may play a role in opiate reward.

The IP administration of 1.0 and 2.0 g/kg ethanol significantly (p less than 0.05) increased the extracellular levels of DA and 5-HT in the ACC whereas the 0.5 g/kg dose caused no change. In general, the extracellular levels of the 3 monoamine metabolites were not altered by IP ethanol except for a slight increase in the levels of homovanillic acid following the 2.0 g/kg dose. Local perfusion of 50 and 100 mM ethanol (but not 25 mM) through the microdialysis probe markedly increased (170-200% of control) the extracellular levels of DA in the ACC. Only the 100 mM concentration of ethanol altered the extracellular levels of 5-HT (2-fold increase), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Addition of 100 microM ICS 205-930 (a 5-HT3 antagonist) to the perfusate markedly reduced the 100 mM ethanol-stimulated release of DA and 5-HT.

RESULTS: The following frequencies of lifetime Axis I comorbid diagnoses were found (in decreasing frequency): any affective disorder (75%), major depressive disorder (63%), any anxiety disorder (36%), any substance abuse disorder (20%), social phobia (17%), generalized anxiety disorder (12%), and panic disorder (10%). In the 44 cases with an affective disorder, 27 (61%) had the onset of affective disorder, 27 (61%) had the onset of their affective disorder prior to the onset of their bulimia, 15 (34%) afterward, and 2 (5%) concurrently. In the 21 cases with any anxiety disorder, 15 (71%) had the onset of their anxiety disorder prior to the onset of their bulimia, 4 (19%) afterward, and 2 (10%) concurrently. CONCLUSION: These data confirm previous reports of a strong association between bulimia nervosa and affective illness, which in most cases precedes the eating disorder.

Then, reinstatement of alcohol-seeking behaviour was evoked by a complex of discrete alcohol-associated cues (auditory and light cues combined with taste and smell of alcohol). Extinction behaviour depended on abstinence duration with maximal responding after 28-day abstinence. Reinstatement of alcohol-seeking behaviour evoked by the discrete cues was highest after 56-day abstinence. No correlations were found between individual alcohol intakes, extinction behaviour and cue-induced reinstatement.

Male rats were given one injection of D-amphetamine (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline every other day for a total of 10 injections. Three weeks after discontinuation of drug treatment, rats were tested for sexual behavior during a test in which microdialysis was performed. There was an augmented efflux of DA in the NAC of D-amphetamine-sensitized rats compared with nonsensitized control rats when a receptive female was present behind a screen (35 vs 17%). Sensitized rats exhibited facilitated sexual behavior when the screen was removed, as indicated by a significantly shorter latency to mount and an overall increase in the amount of copulatory behavior. Although there was a significant increase in NAC DA concentrations from baseline in both sensitized and nonsensitized rats during copulation, there was a greater increase in DA efflux in the NAC of sensitized rats during the first 10 min copulatory sample (60 vs 37%). These results demonstrate that behavioral sensitization caused by repeated psychostimulant administration can 'cross-sensitize' to a natural behavior, such as sex, and that increased NAC DA release may contribute to the facilitation of appetitive and consummatory aspects of this behavior.","Facilitation of sexual behavior and enhanced dopamine efflux in the nucleus accumbens of male rats after D-amphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Fiorino DF and Phillips AG","Drug-related intermittent or continuous access",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 17:59:23,-1,2021-04-01 15:23:19,,,,,,,,

Place aversions were also observed in response to the ICV administration of the selective mu-antagonist CTOP. In contrast, the selective delta-antagonist ICI 174,864 and the selective kappa-antagonist norbinaltorphimine (nor-BNI) (ICV) were without effect.

For those opioid ligands tested, the doses required to produce place aversions were substantially lower following ICV as compared to SC administration. These data confirm that kappa-agonists and opioid antagonists produce aversive states in the drug-naive animal and demonstrate that this effect is centrally mediated. Furthermore, the ability of NLX and CTOP, in contrast to both ICI 174,864 and nor-BNI, to produce place aversions suggests that the aversive effects of opioid antagonists result from the blockade of mu-receptors.","Evidence that the aversive effects of opioid antagonists and kappa-agonists are centrally mediated.","Psychopharmacology","Bals-Kubik R and Herz A and Shippenberg TS","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 17:59:44,-1,2021-04-01 15:23:24,,,,,,,,

Here we assess the response of the human brain to the presentation of appetitive food stimuli during food presentation using PET and FDG. METHOD: Metabolic changes in response to food presentation were done in 12 healthy normal body weight subjects who were food deprived before the study. RESULTS: Food presentation significantly increased metabolism in the whole brain (24%, P < 0.01) and these changes were largest in superior temporal, anterior insula, and orbitofrontal cortices. The increases in the right orbitofrontal cortex were the ones that correlated significantly with the increases in self-reports of hunger and desire for food. DISCUSSION: The marked increase in brain metabolism by the presentation of food provides evidence of the high sensitivity of the human brain to food stimuli. This high sensitivity coupled with the ubiquitousness of food stimuli in the environment is likely to contribute to the epidemic of obesity. In particular, the activation of the right orbitofrontal cortex, a brain region involved with drive, may underlie the motivation to procure food, which may be subjectively experienced as 'desire for food' and 'hunger' when exposed to food stimuli.","Exposure to appetitive food stimuli markedly activates the human brain.","NeuroImage","Wang GJ and Volkow ND and Telang F and Jayne M and Ma J and Rao M and Zhu W and Wong CT and Pappas NR and Geliebter A and Fowler JS","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 18:00:12,-1,2021-04-01 15:23:34,,,,,,,,

An increase in fructose consumption over the past 10-20 years has been linked with a rise in obesity and metabolic disorders. Fructose/sucrose produces deleterious metabolic effects in animal models. This raises concern regarding the short-term and long-term effects of fructose and its risk in humans. RECENT FINDINGS: In rodents, fructose stimulates lipogenesis and leads to hepatic and extrahepatic insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia and high blood pressure. Insulin resistance appears to be related to ectopic lipid deposition. In humans, short-term fructose feeding increases de-novo lipogenesis and blood triglycerides and causes hepatic insulin resistance. There is presently no evidence for fructose-induced muscle insulin resistance in humans. The cellular mechanisms underlying the metabolic effects of fructose involve production of reactive oxygen species, activation of cellular stress pathways and possibly an increase in uric acid synthesis. SUMMARY: Consuming large amounts of fructose can lead to the development of a complete metabolic syndrome in rodents. In humans, fructose consumed in moderate to high quantities in the diet increases plasma triglycerides and alters hepatic glucose homeostasis, but does not appear to cause muscle insulin resistance or high blood pressure in the short term. Further human studies are required to delineate the effects of fructose in humans.","Metabolic effects of fructose.","Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care","Le KA and Tappy L","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 18:00:45,-1,2021-04-01 15:25:12,,,,,,,,

The first objective of the present research was to replicate previous reports that exposure to food cues elicits craving for food. In addition, this investigation was designed to extend the extant literature by testing the effects of 'priming' portions of food, by examining the association between reactivity to food cues and indicators of binge eating, and to examine the role of a putative genetic factor previously found to be associated with cue-elicited craving for alcohol and tobacco. In Study 1, 48 individuals completed measures of craving and mood after exposure to control cues, after exposure to food cues, and after consuming each of three small portions of food. In Study 2, 31 individuals with subclinical symptoms of binge eating completed the same procedures. The results suggested that food cues reliably elicited craving, increased attention to the cues, and decreased positive affect in both samples, although reactivity was greater among the sample with greater eating pathology. Correlational analyses suggested that reactivity to food cues was correlated with binge eating and body mass index among women but not men. Results also suggest that the DRD4 VNTR polymorphism influences cue-elicited craving for food, although the influence of the DRD4 may depend on the population under study.","Cue-elicited craving for food: a fresh approach to the study of binge eating.","Appetite","Sobik L and Hutchison K and Craighead L","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 18:00:57,-1,2021-04-01 15:25:25,,,,,,,,

The present study tested the hypothesis that rats with limited access to highly preferred food would develop analogous opioid-dependent learned adaptations in feeding behavior, with associated changes in metabolism and anxiety-like behavior. For this purpose, adolescent female Wistar rats were daily food deprived (2 h) and then offered 10-min access to a feeder containing chow followed sequentially by 10-min access to a different feeder containing either chow (chow/chow; n=7) or a highly preferred, but macronutrient-comparable, sucrose-rich diet (chow/preferred; n=8). Chow/preferred-fed rats developed binge-like hyperphagia of preferred diet from the second feeder and anticipatory chow hypophagia from the first feeder with a time course suggesting associative learning. The feeding adaptations were dissociable in onset, across individuals, and in their dose-response to the opioid-receptor antagonist nalmefene, suggesting that they represent distinct palatability-motivated processes. Chow/preferred-fed rats showed increased anxiety-like behavior in relation to their propensity to binge as well as increased feed efficiency, body weight, and visceral adiposity. Chow/preferred-fed rats also had increased circulating leptin levels and decreased growth hormone and 'active' ghrelin levels. Thus, the short-term control of food intake in rats with restricted access to highly preferred foods comes to rely more on hedonic, rather than nutritional, properties of food, through associative learning mechanisms. Such rats show changes in ingestive, metabolic, endocrine, and anxiety-related measures, which resemble features of binge eating disorders or obesity.","Opioid-dependent anticipatory negative contrast and binge-like eating in rats with limited access to highly preferred food.","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Cottone P and Sabino V and Steardo L and Zorrilla EP","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,2021-04-01 15:58:53,0,2021-03-29 18:01:27,-1,2021-04-01 15:26:07,,,,,,,,

It is however not completely clear whether the HPA axis is causally or co-incidentally related to (visceral) obesity. This review summarizes supporting data of an involvement of the HPA axis in the development of (visceral) obesity. First, several DNA polymorphisms related to HPA axis functioning are correlated to the development of obesity. Second, chronic elevation of circulatory glucocorticoid concentrations, as in Cushing's disease, results in increased abdominal adiposity. Third, (visceral) obesity is associated with a diminished capacity of cortisol to suppress its own secretion. HPA axis functioning might affect energy balance through affecting energy intake. Both CRH and cortisol influence physiological, central mechanisms involved in the regulation of food intake. Still, general activation of the HPA axis has shown to have inconsistent effects on food intake in humans. This inconsistency may partially be explained by gender differences, individual differences in the functioning of the HPA axis, as well as differences in attitude towards eating. In particular, women with high scores on dietary restraint are prone to stress-induced hyperphagia. Dietary restraint scores, in turn, are positively correlated to basal and dexamethasone-suppressed cortisol levels, indicating a complex dual relationship between stress, HPA axis functioning, attitude towards eating and the risk for stress-induced hyperphagia. In the Western society, with chronically high ambient levels of stress and the availability of high caloric foods, this relationship may imply a risk for the development of (visceral) obesity and the metabolic syndrome.","The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis in the regulation of energy balance.","Physiology & behavior","Nieuwenhuizen AG and Rutters F","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 18:01:51,-1,2021-04-01 15:26:31,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The women with bulimia had significantly lower CSF concentrations of beta-endorphin than did the female comparison subjects. However, CSF concentrations of dynorphin were not significantly different in patients and female or male comparison subjects. beta-Endorphin concentrations were inversely correlated with Beck Depression Inventory scores and the depression subscale of the Eating Disorders Inventory. CONCLUSIONS: These data support a role for central opiates in the mediation of the pathophysiology of the signs and symptoms of bulimia nervosa, although it is impossible to rule out the effects of depression on the results.","CSF beta-endorphin and dynorphin in bulimia nervosa.","The American journal of psychiatry","Brewerton TD and Lydiard RB and Laraia MT and Shook JE and Ballenger JC","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 18:02:04,-1,2021-04-01 15:26:43,,,,,,,,

Identification of relapse predictors may be useful to design effective early intervention strategies for relapse of susceptible patients with bulimia nervosa. METHODS: This multisite study examined relapse in 48 patients with bulimia nervosa who had responded to cognitive behavioral therapy with complete abstinence from binge eating and purging. Structured interviews and questionnaires were used to assess patients before and after treatment and at 4 months after treatment. RESULTS: Four months after treatment, 44% of the patients had relapsed. Those who relapsed had a higher level of preoccupation and ritualization of eating and less motivation for change, and had maintained abstinence for a shorter time during the treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: The predictors of relapse found in this study can be readily determined by clinicians.

In the current study, we sought to determine whether sugar-dependent rats would show increased intake of unsweetened ethanol and, conversely, whether intermittent access to ethanol would augment sugar consumption. In Experiment 1, with intermittent versus ad libitum access to ethanol, Sprague-Dawley rats were given escalating concentrations of ethanol (1%, 2%, 4%, 7%, and 9%) over the course of 20 days. Rats in the intermittent ethanol access group, with 12-h daily access, consumed more 4%, 7%, and 9% ethanol during the first hour of access, and more 9% ethanol daily, than did rats in the ad libitum ethanol access group. In Experiment 2, with ethanol as a gateway to sugar intake, the rats from Experiment 1 were switched to 10% sucrose with 12-h daily access for 1 week. Rats in the intermittent ethanol access group consumed significantly more sugar than was consumed by rats in a control group with no prior ethanol experience. In Experiment 3, with sugar as a gateway to ethanol to determine whether sugar dependence leads to increased ethanol intake, four groups were maintained for 21 days according to the following designations: intermittent access to sugar and chow, ad libitum access to sugar and chow, intermittent access to chow, or ad libitum access to chow. Four days later, all groups were switched to intermittent ethanol access, as described in Experiment 1. The group with intermittent access to sugar and chow consumed the most 9% ethanol, supporting the suggestion that sugar dependence alters a rat's proclivity to drink ethanol. These results may relate to the co-morbidity between binge-eating disorders and alcohol intake and the tendency of people abstaining from alcohol to consume excessive amounts of sugar. In conclusion, bingeing on either ethanol or sugar fosters intake of the other.","Sugar-dependent rats show enhanced intake of unsweetened ethanol.","Alcohol (Fayetteville, N.Y.)","Avena NM and Carrillo CA and Needham L and Leibowitz SF and Hoebel BG","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc),no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 18:02:46,-1,2021-04-01 15:27:53,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Prevalence and correlates of eating disorders from the National Comorbidity Replication, a nationally representative face-to-face household survey (n = 9282), conducted in 2001-2003, were assessed using the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview. RESULTS: Lifetime prevalence estimates of DSM-IV anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder are .9%, 1.5%, and 3.5% among women, and .3% .5%, and 2.0% among men. Survival analysis based on retrospective age-of-onset reports suggests that risk of bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder increased with successive birth cohorts. All 3 disorders are significantly comorbid with many other DSM-IV disorders. Lifetime anorexia nervosa is significantly associated with low current weight (body-mass index <18.5), whereas lifetime binge eating disorder is associated with current severe obesity (body-mass index > or =40). Although most respondents with 12-month bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder report some role impairment (data unavailable for anorexia nervosa since no respondents met criteria for 12-month prevalence), only a minority of cases ever sought treatment.

In the majority of enterostatin studies, however, rats were food-deprived, and the test food was also the maintenance diet. The present study sought to determine if enterostatin would selectively reduce consumption of oil that was provided in addition to a standard diet in non-food-deprived rats. Rats had either continuous (24-h/day) or limited access (120-min/day) to either a 32% sucrose solution or 100% corn oil. In addition to the sucrose and the oil, rats also had 22-h access to a standard pelleted rodent diet. Control rats had unlimited access to the standard diet but no access to oil or sucrose. Rats were maintained on their respective diets for 3 weeks before enterostatin testing. Food intake and body weight were monitored. Rats with continuous access to oil or sucrose consumed more calories and gained more weight than control rats. Caloric intake and body weight of the rats with limited access to oil or sucrose did not differ significantly from controls. Enterostatin, administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) at doses of 0 (vehicle), 89, 178, and 356 microg/kg, had no effect on consumption of oil, sucrose, or standard diet in these non-food-deprivation paradigms; however, 356 microg/kg reduced standard-diet intake when rats were overnight food-deprived, thus verifying peptide activity.

For four rats the dose per injection was fixed at 2.0 mg/kg; for four others the dose per injection was varied irregularly, from one response to the next, between three levels (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg). Regardless of the dosing regimen, extracellular dopamine levels were tonically elevated by 200-800% within the cocaine self-administration periods, fluctuating phasically within this range between responses. In the fixed dose condition, the phasic increases following each injection (and the phasic decreases preceding them) averaged approximately 50% of the mean tonic elevation. Phasic fluctuations in dopamine levels remained time-locked to lever-presses even when response rate was irregular, because of the variable dose condition. In the variable dose condition greater increases in dopamine and longer inter-response times followed injections of the higher doses; dopamine fluctuations were consistent with the multiple-infusion pharmacokinetics of cocaine. DOPAC levels showed a slow tonic depression during cocaine self-administration, but individual injections were not associated with discernible phasic fluctuations of DOPAC. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that falling dopamine levels trigger successive responses in the intravenous cocaine self-administration paradigm, but inconsistent with the notion that extracellular dopamine levels are depleted at the times within sessions when the animal initiates drug-seeking responses.","Fluctuations in nucleus accumbens dopamine concentration during intravenous cocaine self-administration in rats.","Psychopharmacology","Wise RA and Newton P and Leeb K and Burnette B and Pocock D and Justice JB Jr","Drug-related intermittent or continuous access",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 18:42:26,-1,2021-04-01 15:30:09,,,,,,,,

In the monkey striatum, the distribution of preproenkephalin messenger RNA is heterogeneous. There is variation in the general labeling pattern between regions of the striatum. For example, a particularly densely labeled area of preproenkephalin messenger RNA is observed in the ventral part of the caudal putamen. In addition, at the macroscopic level, there are patches of specific hybridization intermingled with areas containing less specific labeling. This forms a mosaic-like pattern. At the microscopic level, densely labeled individual cells are found among those with little or no specific labeling. Adjacent sections, processed for in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, show some correlation between the perikarya containing preproenkephalin messenger RNA and enkephalin-positive fibers in the striatum. Specific hybridization to preproenkephalin messenger RNA is evident throughout the cortical mantle, primarily concentrated in layers 2 and 3.

METHOD: We tested two General Linear Models predicting maximum lifetime BMI with the exon 3 VNTR polymorphism of the dopamine-4 receptor gene (DRD4) and either the Val66Met or the -270C/T polymorphism of BDNF respectively in 163 female probands with BN, purging subtype.

The per capita disappearance data for fructose from the combined consumption of sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup have increased by 26%, from 64 g/d in 1970 to 81 g/d in 1997. Both plasma insulin and leptin act in the central nervous system in the long-term regulation of energy homeostasis. Because fructose does not stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells, the consumption of foods and beverages containing fructose produces smaller postprandial insulin excursions than does consumption of glucose-containing carbohydrate. Because leptin production is regulated by insulin responses to meals, fructose consumption also reduces circulating leptin concentrations. The combined effects of lowered circulating leptin and insulin in individuals who consume diets that are high in dietary fructose could therefore increase the likelihood of weight gain and its associated metabolic sequelae. In addition, fructose, compared with glucose, is preferentially metabolized to lipid in the liver. Fructose consumption induces insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriacylglycerolemia, and hypertension in animal models. The data in humans are less clear. Although there are existing data on the metabolic and endocrine effects of dietary fructose that suggest that increased consumption of fructose may be detrimental in terms of body weight and adiposity and the metabolic indexes associated with the insulin resistance syndrome, much more research is needed to fully understand the metabolic effect of dietary fructose in humans.","Fructose, weight gain, and the insulin resistance syndrome.","The American journal of clinical nutrition","Elliott SS and Keim NL and Stern JS and Teff K and Havel PJ","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 18:42:56,-1,2021-04-01 15:30:26,,,,,,,,

After a 10-day drug free period, each group (n=30) was divided into three subgroups (n=10) and received challenge injections of either cocaine, nicotine or MK-801. The horizontal and vertical movements of the mice were recorded in locomotor activity cages (test cage). Among the various drugs tested, only the cocaine and ethanol experienced mice developed sensitization to a challenge injection of cocaine; MK-801 pretreated mice showed a sensitized response only to a challenge injection of MK-801. In a second experiment, mice in their home cages received (a) saline, (b) cocaine (20 mg/kg) or (c) ethanol (2.0 g/kg) for 5 days, and challenged with an i.p. ethanol injection (2.0 g/kg) after a 10-day drug free period. Both, cocaine and ethanol experienced mice developed marked sensitization to ethanol challenge compared with the saline experienced mice. Assessment of the densities of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) sites (by [3H]mazindol binding) 11 days after the extinction of repeated treatment with either cocaine or ethanol revealed a significant increase (71-108%) in the number of DAT binding sites. Thus, among the various psychostimulants investigated in the present study cross-sensitization between cocaine and ethanol was only observed. The behavioral sensitization we measured was primarily 'drug-dependent', rather than 'context-dependent', because animals were exposed to the test cage only once. The finding that cocaine- and ethanol-induced behavioral sensitization is associated with upregulation of striatal DAT binding sites supports the hypothesis that similar neural substrates are involved in the psychomotor/rewarding effects of cocaine and alcohol.","Effects of cocaine, nicotine, dizocipline and alcohol on mice locomotor activity: cocaine-alcohol cross-sensitization involves upregulation of striatal dopamine transporter binding sites.","Brain research","Itzhak Y and Martin JL","non-experimental study,Drug-related intermittent or continuous access",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 18:43:12,-1,2021-04-01 15:30:34,,,,,,,,

This study examined a newly synthesized GAL antagonist, M40, in two separate experiments involving: (1) PVN injections of M40 alone in freely feeding animals, to investigate the importance of endogenous GAL receptor activity in determining natural patterns of fat ingestion, and (2) PVN injections of M40 in combination with exogenous GAL, to determine whether endogenous GAL receptors mediate this peptide-induced response. The results demonstrate that PVN injection of M40 by itself dose-dependently (2-108 pmol) reduces spontaneous ingestion of the fat diet. This phenomenon is robust, behaviorally specific and opposite to that induced by GAL itself. Moreover, the stimulatory effect of PVN-injected GAL on fat ingestion can be blocked by prior PVN administration of M40 at relatively low doses (2-6 pmol), indicating that M40 is a potent antagonist of GAL receptors in the hypothalamus. Together, these results provide the first evidence for the existence of endogenous GAL receptors in mediating the action of exogenous GAL in the hypothalamus. They also constitute a crucial step in demonstrating a physiological function of these PVN GAL receptors in controlling natural patterns of fat ingestion.","Impact of a galanin antagonist on exogenous galanin and natural patterns of fat ingestion.","Brain research","Leibowitz SF and Kim T","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 18:43:49,-1,2021-04-01 15:30:47,,,,,,,,

The hypothesis outlined here is that knowledge of the neurochemical systems involved in the transition from drug use to the compulsive use of addiction will provide the rational basis for development of pharmacotherapies for drug addiction. Much evidence has been obtained in identifying the midbrain-basal forebrain neural elements involved in the positive reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse and more recently in the neural elements involved in the negative reinforcement associated with drug addiction. Key elements for the acute reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse include a macrostructure in the basal forebrain called the extended amygdala that contains parts of the nucleus accumbens and amgydala and involves key neurotransmitters such as dopamine, opioid peptides, serotonin, GABA, and glutamate. Withdrawal from drugs of abuse is associated with subjective symptoms of negative affect, such as dysphoria, depression, irritability and anxiety, and dysregulation of brain reward systems involving some of the same neurochemical systems implicated in the acute reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse. In addition, acute withdrawal is accompanied by recruitment of the brain stress neurotransmitter system, corticotropin-releasing factor. Animal models of craving involve not only conditioning models but also models of excessive drug intake during prolonged abstinence, post-acute withdrawal, that may reflect continued dysregulation of drug reinforcement that could lead to vulnerability to relapse and represent an important focus for pharmacotherapy. Such changes have been hypothesized to involve a change in set point for drug reward that may represent an allostatic state contributing to vulnerability to relapse and re-entry into the addiction cycle. Elucidation of the specific neuropharmacological changes contributing to this prolonged functional dysregulation will be the challenge of future research on the neurobiology of drug addiction.","Neurobiology of addiction.

The effectiveness of a drug as a reinforcer is modulated by sensitization and habituation to the drug as it is consumed. According to this model, drug taking stops when habituation reduces the ability of the drug to reinforce its own consumption. Drug taking resumes when spontaneous recovery restores the effectiveness of the drug as a reinforcer. This parsimonious model provides a framework for understanding many findings in the drug literature, including acute and chronic tolerance, the effect of deprivation on consumption, the contextual specificity of tolerance, polydrug abuse, cross-sensitization between stress and drugs, behavioral sensitization, priming, and reinstatement. Although this model cannot explain all aspects of drug taking (e.g., the effect of cognitive manipulations), it has many implications for understanding and controlling human drug consumption and addiction.","Regulation of drug taking by sensitization and habituation.","Experimental and clinical psychopharmacology","McSweeney FK and Murphy ES and Kowal BP","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 18:44:16,-1,2021-04-01 15:31:16,,,,,,,,

In this framework, addiction is conceptualized as a cycle of decreased function of brain reward systems and recruitment of antireward systems that progressively worsen, resulting in the compulsive use of drugs. Counteradaptive processes, such as opponent process, that are part of the normal homeostatic limitation of reward function fail to return within the normal homeostatic range and are hypothesized to repeatedly drive the allostatic state. Excessive drug taking thus results in not only the short-term amelioration of the reward deficit but also suppression of the antireward system. However, in the long term, there is worsening of the underlying neurochemical dysregulations that ultimately form an allostatic state (decreased dopamine and opioid peptide function, increased corticotropin-releasing factor activity). This allostatic state is hypothesized to be reflected in a chronic deviation of reward set point that is fueled not only by dysregulation of reward circuits per se but also by recruitment of brain and hormonal stress responses. Vulnerability to addiction may involve genetic comorbidity and developmental factors at the molecular, cellular, or neurocircuitry levels that sensitize the brain antireward systems.","Addiction and the brain antireward system.","Annual review of psychology","Koob GF and Le Moal M","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 18:45:36,-1,2021-04-01 15:31:30,,,,,,,,

The present experiment was designed to determine whether HiS and LoS rats differed in other aspects of drug abuse. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present experiment was to use a two-lever dose self-selection procedure to investigate the regulation/dysregulation of i.v. cocaine self-administration in female HiS and LoS rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HiS and LoS rats were trained to self-administer eight different doses of cocaine during daily 5-h sessions, with the cocaine doses ranging from 0.2 to 1.6 mg/kg in steps of 0.2 mg/kg. The dose size increased after a response on one lever (infusion duration lengthened by 3 s) and decreased after a response on the other lever (infusion duration shortened by 3 s), with a lower limit of 0 s and with an upper limit of 24 s (a corresponding range of 0 to 1.6 mg/kg); the animals increased or decreased their self-administered dose in nine discrete steps. RESULTS: The HiS rats showed less precise regulation of their postinfusion interval (PII) than LoS rats based on the size of the previously self-administered cocaine dose. Correlations between these variables were lower for HiS than for LoS rats during the acquisition and maintenance phases, and HiS rats had lower PIIs than LoS rats after many of the cocaine doses. The HiS rats also self-administered significantly more cocaine infusions during the maintenance phase than the LoS rats, especially at the highest dose. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that HiS rats are more likely to self-administer more cocaine infusions, at higher doses, and with less precise dose-time regulation than LoS rats. Thus, rats selectively bred for HiS showed less inhibitory control over their cocaine intake than LoS rats, suggesting that a genetic predisposition for saccharin preference is related to the rewarding effects of i.v. cocaine.","Regulation of intravenous cocaine self-administration in rats selectively bred for high (HiS) and low (LoS) saccharin intake.","Psychopharmacology","Carroll ME and Anderson MM and Morgan AD","Drug-related intermittent or continuous access",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 18:45:52,-1,2021-04-01 15:31:43,,,,,,,,

Amphetamine pretreatment produced psychomotor sensitization and also accelerated the subsequent escalation of cocaine intake.

Binge-type foods are often rich in fat, sugar, or both. The opiate antagonist naloxone reduced the consumption of sweet high-fat foods in obese and lean female binge-eaters, though not in nonbinging controls. In contrast, obese as opposed to lean subjects were not differentially affected by naloxone.

We hypothesized that caloric restriction and stress interact in a unique manner to promote binge eating. To test this hypothesis, a group of young female rats were cycled through a restriction period (4 days of 66% of control food intake) followed by 6 days of free feeding prior to being stressed by acute foot shock. After three of these cycles, the food intake of rats exposed only to restriction (R), or only to stress (S), did not differ from controls. However, R+S rats that were restricted and refed, despite normal body weight and food intake after free feeding, engaged in a powerful bout of hyperphagia when stressed (Experiment 1). The R + S effect was replicated in an older group of rats (Experiment 2). The hyperphagia was characteristically binge-like, it constituted a 40% selective increase in highly palatable (HP) food (P < .001) over a discrete period of time (within 24 h post-stress), and reflected feeding for reward (higher HP:chow ratio) over metabolic need as occurred after restriction (higher chow:HP ratio). Subsequent experiments revealed that binge eating did not occur if only chow was available (Experiment 3) or if restriction-refeeding (R-R) did not proximally precede stress (Experiment 4). Experiment 5 revealed that a history of R-R cycles followed by only one stress episode was sufficient to increase intake to 53% above controls as early as 2 h after stress (P < .001). This animal model of binge eating should facilitate investigations into the neurochemical changes induced by dieting and environmental stress to produce disordered eating and provide a preclinical tool to test preventive strategies and treatments more relevant to bulimia nervosa, multiple cases of binge eating disorder (BED) and binge-purge type anorexia nervosa.","A new animal model of binge eating: key synergistic role of past caloric restriction and stress.","Physiology & behavior","Hagan MM and Wauford PK and Chandler PC and Jarrett LA and Rybak RJ and Blackburn K","",-1,2021-04-01 15:59:40,0,2021-03-29 18:46:45,-1,2021-04-01 15:36:47,,,,,,,,

Five groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were used, all of which had continuous access to a standard rodent diet and water. The control group had no access to shortening.

At the end of the study rats were sacrificed and carcass composition determined. As access to the shortening decreased, consumption during the 2-h access period increased. Rats compensated for the increased shortening consumption by decreasing intake of the standard diet. Thus, cumulative energy consumption did not differ among the groups. When switched between the high and low conditions, rats rapidly adjusted to the change in shortening availability. There were no effects of access schedule on carcass composition.

To test potential presynaptic components of behavioral sensitization, the behavioral and neurochemical response to amphetamine administration in the accumbens shell and core was measured at early (days 1-3) and late (days 20-22) withdrawal in rats pretreated with systemic cocaine (15 mg/kg x 2 days, 30 mg/kg x 5 days) or saline. Behavioral sensitization was observed at late, but not early withdrawal when amphetamine was microinjected into the nucleus accumbens shell of cocaine-pretreated rats. There were no significant differences between cocaine- and saline-pretreated animals when behavior was monitored after amphetamine injections into the core at either withdrawal period. After both withdrawal periods, the amphetamine-induced increase in extracellular dopamine was potentiated among cocaine-pretreated animals in the shell by the local administration of amphetamine (0.03, 0.3, 3.0 and 30 microM through the dialysis probe). In the core at early withdrawal there was tolerance to the amphetamine-induced increase in extracellular dopamine in the cocaine group, whereas there was no difference between the repeated saline and cocaine groups at late withdrawal.

The significant changes in animals self-administering the drug were prominent in limbic regions with increases in the frontal cortex and decreases in the pyriform cortex, nucleus accumbens, amygdala and ventral tegmental area.

These data and turnover rates for dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, aspartate, glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid previously determined in similarly treated animals are consistent with two neuronal circuits that may be involved in opiate seeking behaviors and opiate reinforcement processes.","Limbic acetylcholine turnover rates correlated with rat morphine-seeking behaviors.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior","Smith JE and Co C and Lane JD","Drug-related intermittent or continuous access",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 18:48:24,-1,2021-04-01 15:39:42,,,,,,,,

To determine whether cocaine and/or chronic withdrawal from cocaine alters the specific components of the opioid and adenosine systems, we carried out quantitative autoradiographic mapping of mu-opioid, A1 and A2A adenosine receptors in the brains of rats treated with an escalating dose 'binge' cocaine administration paradigm and of rats chronically withdrawn from cocaine. Male Fischer rats were injected with saline or cocaine (15 x 3 mg/kg/day for 4 days, 20 x 3 mg/kg/day for 4 days, 25 x 3 mg/kg/day for 4 days and 30 x 3 mg/kg/day for 2 days) at 1-h intervals for 14 days. Similarly treated rats were withdrawn from that paradigm for 14 days. A significant increase in [(3)H]DAMGO binding to mu-receptors was detected in the frontal and cingulate cortex, as well as in the caudate putamen, of long-term withdrawn rats after an escalating dose 'binge' cocaine administration paradigm and in chronic cocaine-treated rats. No significant cocaine-induced change was found in A1 or A2A receptor binding in any region analyzed.

In 3-hr tests of free-feeding (satiated) rats, intra-ACB administration of the mu receptor agonist D-Ala2,N,Me-Phe4, Gly-ol5-enkephalin (DAMGO; 0, 0.025, 0.25 and 2.5 micrograms bilaterally) markedly enhanced the intake of fat or carbohydrate when the diets were presented individually (although the effect on fat intake was much greater in magnitude). Intra-ACB injections of DAMGO, however, produced potent preferential stimulatory effects on fat ingestion with no effect on carbohydrate ingestion when both fat and carbohydrate diets were present simultaneously. Moreover, this selective stimulation of fat intake was independent of base-line diet preference and could be blocked by systemic injection of naltrexone (5 mg/kg). We also examined the effect of 24-hr food deprivation on the pattern of macronutrient intake in rats with access to both carbohydrate and fat. In contrast to the DAMGO-induced selective enhancement of fat intake, food deprivation significantly increased the intake of both diets to the same extent; however, in this case, only the stimulated fat intake was blocked by systemic naltrexone. Intra-ACB administration of DAMGO in hungry rats produced an effect similar to that observed in free-feeding rats; preference was strongly shifted to fat intake. Similarly, the opioid antagonist naltrexone (20 micrograms) infused directly into ACB preferentially decreased fat intake in hungry rats. These findings suggest that endogenous opioids within the ventral striatum may participate in the mechanisms governing preferences for highly palatable foods, especially those rich in fat.","Intake of high-fat food is selectively enhanced by mu opioid receptor stimulation within the nucleus accumbens.","The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics","Zhang M and Gosnell BA and Kelley AE","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 18:49:01,-1,2021-04-01 15:40:22,,,,,,,,

In the light of recent evidence that the gastrointestinal hormone cholecystokinin induces satiety and reduces food intake in laboratory animals and humans, we investigated the hypothesis that abnormalities in cholecystokinin secretion and satiety may occur in patients with bulimia and contribute to their disturbed eating patterns. Blood levels of cholecystokinin and subjective satiety were measured in 14 women with bulimia and 10 normal women before and after a mixed-liquid meal. The total integrated plasma cholecystokinin response to eating was significantly impaired in patients with bulimia (P less than 0.05) as was postprandial satiety. Fasting cholecystokinin levels were similar in both populations (approximately 0.8 pmol per liter). After eating, however, mean (+/- SEM) peak plasma cholecystokinin levels increased to 4.1 +/- 0.9 pmol per liter in normal controls but to only 2.1 +/- 0.2 pmol per liter in patients with bulimia nervosa (P less than 0.05). After an open trial of tricyclic antidepressants in a subgroup of five patients with bulimia, the postprandial cholecystokinin response to eating increased significantly, to 6.6 +/- 1.2 pmol per liter (P less than 0.05), and there was an increase in the satiety response.

The addition of acarbose, a drug that inhibits the digestion of sucrose, to the 32% sucrose solution blocked the blood glucose rise, as did closing the pylorus with an inflatable pyloric cuff. Neither the drug nor the cuff, however, reduced the amount of sucrose solution consumed. These findings indicate that gastric sham feeding does not necessarily prevent the digestion and absorption of food, although absorption is not essential for the appearance of a vigorous sham-feeding response.

Withdrawal from morphine resulted in a marked reduction of extracellular DA concentrations from control values at 1, 2, 3, and 5 days of withdrawal. After 7 days of withdrawal, DA output was less, but still significantly, reduced. Challenge with morphine resulted in stimulation of DA output in controls (maximum, 35%), no effect on the first day of withdrawal, and stimulation similar to controls' on days 2 and 7 of withdrawal. On day 5 and, particularly, on day 3 of withdrawal, morphine-induced stimulation of DA output was markedly potentiated (maximum, 100 and 160%, respectively). Changes in the sensitivity of DA transmission to morphine challenge were associated with changes in the behavioral stimulant effects of morphine, with tolerance on day 1 and marked sensitization on days 3 and 5 but also on day 7, when morphine-induced stimulation of transmission was no longer potentiated. The results indicate that repeated morphine administration induces a state of dependence in DA neurons and a short-lasting tolerance followed by an increased sensitivity to its stimulant effects on DA transmission. These changes might play an important role in the development of opiate addiction and in the maintenance of opiate self-administration in dependent subjects.","Depression of mesolimbic dopamine transmission and sensitization to morphine during opiate abstinence.","Journal of neurochemistry","Acquas E and Di Chiara G","Drug-related intermittent or continuous access",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 18:49:47,-1,2021-04-01 15:42:07,,,,,,,,

We examined the dosage-response and time-course characteristics of the effect of insulin on leptin in 10 men (age 42+/-2 years [mean+/-SE]; BMI 29.3+/-2.0 kg/m2). Each individual underwent four 9-h euglycemic clamps (insulin at 20, 40, 80, and 400 mU x m[-2] x min[-1) and a control saline infusion. Although plasma glucose and insulin levels remained constant, leptin diminished from 9.1+/-3.0 to 5.9+/-2.1 ng/ml (P < 0.001) by the end of the control experiment. Conversely, plasma leptin showed a dosage-dependent increase during the insulin infusions that was evident within 30-60 min. The insulin-induced increase in leptin was proportionately lower in obese insulin-resistant men. Free fatty acids (FFAs) decreased during insulin and did not change during saline infusions. ED50 (the dose producing half-maximal effect) for insulin's effect on leptin and FFA was similar (138+/-36 vs. 102+/-24 pmol/l, respectively; P=0.11). To further define the role of physiological insulinemia, we compared the effect of a very low dosage insulin infusion (10 mU x m[-2] x min[-1]) with that of a control saline infusion in another group of 10 men (mean age 39+/-3 years; BMI 27.1+/-1.0 kg/m2). Plasma leptin remained stable during that insulin infusion, but fell by 37+/-2% in the control experiment. Thus physiological insulinemia can acutely regulate plasma leptin. Insulin could mediate the effect of caloric intake on leptin and could be a determinant of its plasma concentration. Inadequate insulin-induced leptin production in obese and insulin-resistant subjects may contribute to the development or worsening of obesity.","Physiological insulinemia acutely modulates plasma leptin.","Diabetes","Saad MF and Khan A and Sharma A and Michael R and Riad-Gabriel MG and Boyadjian R and Jinagouda SD and Steil GM and Kamdar V","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 18:49:59,-1,2021-04-01 15:42:10,,,,,,,,

Constant supplemental infusion of a portion of each rat's mean hourly intake increased the mean time between successive infusions, but the effect was not statistically reliable from the data of a small sample of animals.

Unit doses of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg of cocaine or 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/kg of heroin were made available with equal frequency but in unpredictable sequence to independent groups of rats. The mean time between successive infusions was linearly related to the log dose of the preceding infusion in each case. Pimozide, a drug thought to attenuate the reinforcing effects of both cocaine and heroin, shifted the functions without disturbing the dose-response relations; pimozide reliably decreased the time between successive cocaine infusions across a 4-fold range of pimozide doses. The effect of pimozide on heroin self-administration was not statistically significant and disrupted responding at the highest dose tested. This paradigm thus offers a within-session assessment of the dose-dependent duration of reinforcing actions of cocaine and heroin, and this assessment is sensitive to at least one challenge of intravenous drug reinforcement.","Pharmacological regulation of intravenous cocaine and heroin self-administration in rats: a variable dose paradigm.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior","Gerber GJ and Wise RA","Drug-related intermittent or continuous access",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 18:50:10,-1,2021-04-01 15:42:14,,,,,,,,

To determine if a similar phenomenon occurred with stress-induced sensitization, male Sprague-Dawley rats were given a sham ADX, ADX surgery, or ADX plus s.c. implanted corticosterone (CORT) pellets (CORT 12.5% pellets or CORT 50% pellets). A fifth group was given ADX surgery, but CORT 50% pellets were implanted after repeated stress treatment. One week after surgery, each group was divided into two additional groups, naive and stress. Naive animals remained unhandled, while stress rats were given a variety of daily stressors administered twice per day for 6 consecutive days. One day after the last stress, rats were given a saline injection followed by a cocaine injection (15 mg/kg, i.p.) the next day, and locomotor activity was monitored (early withdrawal). Two weeks after the last stress, the locomotor responses to an additional saline and cocaine injection were monitored (late withdrawal). At early withdrawal, no significant sensitization occurred for horizontal activity, but cross-sensitization was demonstrated for vertical activity. At late withdrawal, sham controls showed a stress-induced elevation in horizontal activity, with only a trend toward increased vertical activity. Animals given ADX surgery or ADX and CORT 12.5% pellets did not demonstrate sensitization to repeated stress, while CORT 50% pellets in ADX rats restored the sensitized horizontal response to cocaine challenge at late withdrawal. In contrast, stress-pretreated rats which were given CORT 50% pellets during the 2-week withdrawal period after the stress showed a marked decrease in horizontal activity in response to cocaine challenge at late withdrawal. The results provide evidence for a necessary role for adrenal hormones in long term, but not short-term, stress-induced cross-sensitization. Together with our previous study on the role of CORT in cocaine-induced sensitization, the results indicate that CORT is not the common factor mediating the long-term sensitization to cocaine and stress.","Stress-induced cross-sensitization to cocaine: effect of adrenalectomy and corticosterone after short- and long-term withdrawal.","Psychopharmacology","Prasad BM and Ulibarri C and Sorg BA","Drug-related intermittent or continuous access,no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 18:50:35,-1,2021-04-01 15:42:20,,,,,,,,

Our aim was to explore the nature of the co-morbid relation between AUDs and eating disorders in a large and phenotypically well-characterized group of individuals. METHOD: We compared diagnostic and personality profiles of 97 women with lifetime anorexia nervosa only, 282 women with lifetime bulimia nervosa only, and 293 women with a lifetime history of both anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa with binge eating (ANBN) (DSM-IV criteria). All individuals were participants in a multicenter study of the genetics of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. We explored pattern of onset, Axis I and II comorbidity, and personality characteristics of individuals with and without AUDs by eating disorder subtype. Personality characteristics were assessed with the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, the Temperament and Character Inventory, and the Barratt Impulsivity Scale. RESULTS: Alcohol use disorders were significantly more prevalent in women with ANBN and bulimia nervosa than in women with anorexia nervosa (p =.0001). The majority of individuals reported primary onset of the eating disorder, with only one third reporting the onset of the AUD first. After eating disorder subtype was controlled for, AUDs were associated with the presence of major depressive disorder, a range of anxiety disorders, and cluster B personality disorder symptoms. In addition, individuals with AUDs presented with personality profiles marked by impulsivity and perfectionism. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with eating disorders and AUDs exhibit phenotypic profiles characterized by both anxious, perfectionistic traits and impulsive, dramatic dispositions. These traits mirror the pattern of control and dyscontrol seen in individuals with this comorbid profile and suggest that anxiety modulation may be related to alcohol use in this group.","Alcohol use disorder comorbidity in eating disorders: a multicenter study.","The Journal of clinical psychiatry","Bulik CM and Klump KL and Thornton L and Kaplan AS and Devlin B and Fichter MM and Halmi KA and Strober M and Woodside DB and Crow S and Mitchell JE and Rotondo A and Mauri M and Cassano GB and Keel PK and Berrettini WH and Kaye WH","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 18:54:01,-1,2021-04-01 15:43:50,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Data were collected from a cross-sectional study using the Eating and Appraisal Due to Emotions and Stress Questionnaire. SUBJECTS/SETTING: Convenience sample from a southeastern public university, including staff and faculty (n=822) with ages ranging from 18 to 83 years and 55.8% of the sample being overweight or obese. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PERFORMED: Total sum scores were given to each construct and converted to quartiles. Lower quartiles represented higher stress- or emotion-related eating and more compromised appraisal skills or resources to cope. chi(2) Analyses were used to identify variables associated with overweight and obesity. Forward stepwise logistic regression (n=783) was used to identify the independent association of each significant variable with overweight and obesity. RESULTS: A model including race, sex, life stage, and job category as covariates, with a cumulative R(2) of 0.075 was produced. Emotion- and Stress-Related Eating remained in the model during stepwise regression producing a cumulative R(2)=0.265.

The research generated by these hypotheses has yielded results that are far more complicated than the simplest form of either hypothesis would indicate. Pharmacological or lesion-induced interference with DA function does not suppress all aspects of movement control, nor all aspects of reward, nor all aspects of motivation. The deficits produced by interference with DA systems are selective and dissociative in nature, affecting some aspects of motor or motivational function, but leaving others basically intact. In some sense the hypotheses that DA is involved in 'motor' or 'reward' or 'motivational' processes are partly correct, but the processes to which these terms refer are too broad to offer an accurate and detailed description of the behavioral functions of brain DA. A review of the literature on the behavioral pharmacology of DA suggests that the behaviors most easily disrupted by DA antagonists are highly activated and complex learned instrumental responses that are elicited or supported by mild conditioned stimuli, and maintained for considerable periods of time. It is proposed that DA in accumbens and striatum modulates the ability of neocortical and limbic areas involved in sensory, associative, and affective processes to influence complex aspects of motor function, and also modulates the execution of complex motor acts organized by the neocortex. Thus, interference with DA systems produces a 'subcortical apraxia', which dissociates complex stimulus processes from complex motor processes, but leaves aspects of those processes intact.","Complex motor and sensorimotor functions of striatal and accumbens dopamine: involvement in instrumental behavior processes.","Psychopharmacology","Salamone JD","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 18:54:20,-1,2021-04-01 15:46:15,,,,,,,,

Methylephenidate clears from the brain at a much slower rate and is less addictive than cocaine. We postulate that periodic and frequent stimulation of the dopaminergic system secondary to chronic use of cocaine favors activation of a circuit that involves the orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, thalamus and striatum. This circuit is abnormal in cocaine abusers and we postulate that is activation by cocaine perpetuates the compulsive administration of the drug and is perceived by the cocaine abuser as a intense desire resulting in the loss of control over the drive to take more cocaine.","Cocaine addiction: hypothesis derived from imaging studies with PET.","Journal of addictive diseases","Volkow ND and Ding YS and Fowler JS and Wang GJ","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 18:54:39,-1,2021-04-01 15:46:53,,,,,,,,

Rats with bilateral cholinotoxic (AF64A) lesions in the nucleus accumbens showed a significant and lasting lag in body weight gain in comparison to the sham-operated controls. This failure to gain weight was not due to a decrease in feeding because lesioned rats actually ate more food and drank more water than controls under basal conditions. Lesion-induced deficits were also exposed when the rats were challenged with food deprivation or cold exposure. Lesioned rats ate less than controls when 24 h food deprived and maintained both a higher core temperature and a higher metabolic rate than controls following either 24-h food deprivation or exposure to cold. Thyroid hormones, insulin, and blood glucose levels were, however, within the physiological range, and no sensory and motor disturbances were observed. The results suggest that the altered body weight regulation is partly due to the enhanced metabolic responsiveness to stress.

The theory addresses three fundamental questions. The first is: why do addicts crave drugs? That is, what is the psychological and neurobiological basis of drug craving? The second is: why does drug craving persist even after long periods of abstinence? The third is whether 'wanting' drugs (drug craving) is attributable to 'liking' drugs (to the subjective pleasurable effects of drugs)? The theory posits the following. (1) Addictive drugs share the ability to enhance mesotelencephalic dopamine neurotransmission. (2) One psychological function of this neural system is to attribute 'incentive salience' to the perception and mental representation of events associated with activation of the system. Incentive salience is a psychological process that transforms the perception of stimuli, imbuing them with salience, making them attractive, 'wanted', incentive stimuli. (3) In some individuals the repeated use of addictive drugs produces incremental neuroadaptations in this neural system, rendering it increasingly and perhaps permanently, hypersensitive ('sensitized') to drugs and drug-associated stimuli. The sensitization of dopamine systems is gated by associative learning, which causes excessive incentive salience to be attributed to the act of drug taking and to stimuli associated with drug taking. It is specifically the sensitization of incentive salience, therefore, that transforms ordinary 'wanting' into excessive drug craving. (4) It is further proposed that sensitization of the neural systems responsible for incentive salience ('for wanting') can occur independently of changes in neural systems that mediate the subjective pleasurable effects of drugs (drug 'liking') and of neural systems that mediate withdrawal. Thus, sensitization of incentive salience can produce addictive behavior (compulsive drug seeking and drug taking) even if the expectation of drug pleasure or the aversive properties of withdrawal are diminished and even in the face of strong disincentives, including the loss of reputation, job, home and family. We review evidence for this view of addiction and discuss its implications for understanding the psychology and neurobiology of addiction.","The neural basis of drug craving: an incentive-sensitization theory of addiction.","Brain research.

The effects on ACh in the NAC and STR were also observed in response to water intake in 20-h water-deprived animals. Neostigmine was used in the perfusate to improve ACh recovery. Basal ACh was sensitive to tetrodotoxin and low calcium, and therefore largely neuronal in origin. Feeding caused a 38% increase in extracellular ACh in the NAC and no change in the STR or HIPP. Dopamine was also increased in the NAC (48%) and to a lesser extent in the STR (21%) following feeding. Drinking caused 18-20% increases in ACh release in both the NAC and STR. In a separate experiment, ACh release in the NAC was monitored in 10-min intervals during free-feeding; ACh increased in the interval immediately following maximal food intake. These results suggest a site-specific increase in ACh release following feeding that cannot be solely attributed to the activation associated with this behavior.","Effects of feeding and drinking on acetylcholine release in the nucleus accumbens, striatum, and hippocampus of freely behaving rats.","Journal of neurochemistry","Mark GP and Rada P and Pothos E and Hoebel BG","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc)",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 18:57:55,-1,2021-04-02 16:13:45,,,,,,,,

Neurosci., 17, 851-861). The present study shows that an unfamiliar food (Kinder(R)) with a taste and composition (milk chocolate) different from that of Fonzies, also induces a release of DA in the NAc subjected to one-trial habituation. Habituation was taste specific as no cross-habituation was observed between Fonzies and Kinder. In undeprived rats, a 40-min exposure to an intrinsic appetitive stimulus (food smell arising from a Fonzies-filled plastic box) also prevented the increase in dialysate DA associated with Fonzies feeding, and this effect was partially reversed by food deprivation. Food deprivation also prevented habituation of Fonzies-induced increase of dialysate DA in the NAc. Predictive association of an empty plastic box to Fonzies feeding resulted in the acquisition of appetitive properties by the box and in facilitation (rather than inhibition) of the phasic responsiveness of DA transmission to Fonzies feeding. A 10-min pre-exposure to appetitive olfactory stimuli intrinsic to Fonzies still prevented, like a 40-min pre-exposure, the NAc DA response to Fonzies feeding; however, a 5-min pre-exposure to these appetitive stimuli did not prevent the DA response in the NAc. These results show that the phasic responsiveness of NAc DA transmission to an unfamiliar palatable food is under strong modulatory control by primary (consummatory) and secondary (appetitive) stimuli, and that the sign and extent of this control depends on the nature of the appetitive stimulus, delay of reward and motivational state (deprivation).","Modulation of feeding-induced activation of mesolimbic dopamine transmission by appetitive stimuli and its relation to motivational state.","The European journal of neuroscience","Bassareo V and Di Chiara G","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 18:58:29,-1,2021-04-02 16:14:37,,,,,,,,

This process partly depends on the ability of the organism to make associations between the environmental context and the internal representation of value. While this type of learning probably evolved in order to promote behaviors that increase fitness (e.g., ingestive and sexual behavior), neuropsychological research utilizing addictive drugs, which are potent artificial reinforcers, has led to a deeper understanding of reinforcement mechanisms. Through these associations, sensory cues can acquire emotional salience and motivational properties. Exposure to drug-related cues in human addicts results in drug craving and localized activation of central circuits that are known to mediate cue-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior in animal models of relapse. Similar regional activation patterns occur in humans in response to cues associated with foods. Furthermore, drug- and food-related cues not only activate common neuroanatomical regions but also result in similar activity-regulated gene expression programs within these shared areas. Here we discuss recent studies from our laboratory that investigate gene expression patterns elicited by exposure to palatable food- or drug-related cues. These studies suggest that the central nervous system stores and utilizes information about 'natural' and drug reinforcers in similar ways, both neuroanatomically and biochemically. These considerations may have important implications for the pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral treatments of substance use disorders, addiction, eating disorders, and obesity.","Neural systems recruited by drug- and food-related cues: studies of gene activation in corticolimbic regions.","Physiology & behavior","Kelley AE and Schiltz CA and Landry CF","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 18:58:36,-1,2021-04-02 16:17:09,,,,,,,,

Although each new signalling pathway discovered in the hypothalamus is a potential target for drug development in the treatment of obesity, the growing number of such signalling molecules indicates that food intake is controlled by a highly complex process.

Binge eaters suffer from high standards and expectations, especially an acute sensitivity to the difficult (perceived) demands of others. When they fall short of these standards, they develop an aversive pattern of high self-awareness, characterized by unflattering views of self and concern over how they are perceived by others. These aversive self-perceptions are accompanied by emotional distress, which often includes anxiety and depression. To escape from this unpleasant state, binge eaters attempt the cognitive response of narrowing attention to the immediate stimulus environment and avoiding broadly meaningful thought. This narrowing of attention disengages normal inhibitions against eating and fosters an uncritical acceptance of irrational beliefs and thoughts.

We examined the association of adult weight gain and obesity with subscales of eating behavior characteristics in older women. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Current height and weight, eating behavior subscales (disinhibition subscales-habitual, situational, and emotional; restraint subscales-flexible and rigid; hunger subscales-internal and external) as assessed using the Eating Inventory (EI), and self-reported body weight at six prior age intervals were reported by 535 women aged 55-65 years. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the relationships between EI subscale scores and weight change from the age interval of 30-39 to 55-60 years and current BMI. RESULTS: The strongest correlate of weight gain over 20 years was susceptibility to overeating in response to everyday cues within the environment (habitual disinhibition; partial correlation coefficient (r) = 0.25, P < 0.001); susceptibility to overeating in response to emotional states such as depression (emotional disinhibition) was a quantitatively weaker but significant correlate (partial r = 0.17, P < 0.001), and susceptibility to overeating in response to specific situations such as social occasions (situational disinhibition) was not associated with weight gain. Flexible control of dietary restraint attenuated the influence of habitual disinhibition in particular on weight gain and BMI, and was less effective in attenuating associations of emotional or situational disinhibition. DISCUSSION: Lifestyle modification programs for prevention and treatment of adult-onset obesity currently focus on reducing situational and emotional overeating; the results of this study suggest that a stronger emphasis on strategies that target habitual overeating may be warranted.","Aspects of eating behaviors 'disinhibition' and 'restraint' are related to weight gain and BMI in women.","Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)","Hays NP and Roberts SB","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-29 18:59:25,-1,2021-04-02 16:27:13,,,,,,,,

The introduction sketches the results of earlier studies with local drug injections and selective neurotoxins which provided pharmacological evidence that monoamines can influence food intake and body weight. A table summarizing this evidence is used to list monoamine changes that could underlie anorexia or hyperphagia. It is apparent that abnormalities in the monoamines, along with their cotransmitters, could cause many forms of feeding disorder. It is proposed as a working hypothesis that several varieties of hyperphagia leading to obesity have a common element. This common factor is a change in excitability of a lateral hypothalamic reinforcement system as manifested in self-stimulation at a stimulation-bound feeding site. Understanding this feeding reward-aversion system helps us understand hyperphagia and anorexia. The neurochemistry of reward and aversion involves the monoamines. This paper focuses on dopamine and serotonin. The data support the hypothesis that dopamine systems projecting to the nucleus accumbens and other forebrain areas from the mid-brain ventral tegmental area (VTA) are important for approach and positive reinforcement in ingestive behavior and self-stimulation. Serotonin is hypothesized to facilitate satiety and inhibition of feeding reward in the hypothalamus. The next section abstracts our recent experiments that measured pharmacological and physiological release of the monoamines in the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens during ingestive behavior and self-stimulation. In vivo microdialysis in freely moving rats suggested the following: (1) Norepinephrine was released in the paraventricular nucleus during the active, feeding period of the circadian cycle. (2) The serotonin metabolite 5-HIAA also increased in the PVN at the same time if there was food to eat. (3) Amphetamine infused into the lateral hypothalamus (LH) by reverse dialysis increased synaptic dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. (4) The anorectic drug d-fenfluramine increased synaptic serotonin in the LH and also increased the dopamine metabolite DOPAC, suggesting that serotonin and dopamine in the LH might contribute to fenfluramine-induced satiety. Local d-fenfluramine injection into the LH or local infusion by reverse dialysis again increased serotonin and decreased 5-HIAA and interfered with local dopamine metabolism as reflected in decreased DOPAC and HVA. (5) Tryptophan, a serotonin precursor, given systemically at an anorectic dose, increased extracellular serotonin in the LH, but this effect was only detectable in food-deprived rats. This was seemingly pH independent (between 5.8 and 8).

Using receptor autoradiography, twice daily injections of cocaine produced an upregulation of mu opioid receptors in the rostral nucleus accumbens, rostral caudate putamen, and layer I of the rostral cingulate cortex, whereas single daily injections resulted in a significant increase in the nucleus accumbens only. Only small insignificant increases in kappa opioid receptor densities were found following either once or twice daily cocaine injections, whereas three daily injections produced an increase in kappa receptor density in the cingulate cortex, nucleus accumbens, and caudate putamen. Increased dopamine D1 receptor binding was found in the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle following twice daily cocaine injections, but not after single daily injections of the same total daily dose. These results demonstrate that the same total daily dose of cocaine administered in multiple small injections produces a greater effect on receptor regulation than a single larger injection. This suggests that the interval between cocaine injections is an important variable when studying the effects of cocaine on neurochemistry.","The frequency of cocaine administration impacts cocaine-induced receptor alterations.","Brain research","Unterwald EM and Kreek MJ and Cuntapay M","Drug-related intermittent or continuous access",-1,,-1,2021-03-30 11:50:49,-1,2021-04-02 16:41:26,,,,,,,,

Opioid peptides within the ventral striatum are thought to play a key role in the latter function, regulating the affective response to highly palatable, energy-dense foods such as those containing fat and sugar. It has been shown previously that stimulation of mu opiate receptors within the ventral striatum increases intake of palatable food. In the present study, we examined enkephalin peptide gene expression within the striatum in rats that had been given restricted daily access to an energy-dense, palatable liquid food, chocolate Ensure(R). Rats maintained on an ad libitum diet of rat chow and water were given 3-h access to Ensure(R) daily for two weeks. One day following the end of this period, preproenkephalin gene expression was measured with quantitative in situ hybridization. Compared with control animals, rats that had been exposed to Ensure(R) had significantly reduced enkephalin gene expression in several striatal regions including the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens), a finding that was confirmed in a different group with Northern blot analysis. Rats fed this regimen of Ensure(R) did not differ in weight from controls. In contrast to chronic Ensure(R), acute ingestion of Ensure(R) did not appear to affect enkephalin peptide gene expression.

Furthermore, factors affecting initiation, abstinence, and relapse to the use of tobacco, alcohol, and opioids are similar in nature. In addition, there are similarities in the addictive process underlying the use of these substances. Taken together, these data suggest that tobacco use is involved, possibly more than by simple association, in the use of other substances containing psychoactive chemicals. In the present paper we discuss the involvement of tobacco in the use of alcohol, opioids, cocaine, and other substances, as well as some of the implications of these observations for researchers and clinicians. One such implication is that it may be possible to use tobacco and nicotine as models for phenomena of interest to other substance use researchers. For example, drug abuse treatment and prevention strategies could be explored using tobacco use as a target behavior, and biological phenomena such as the development of tolerance and physical dependence may be more readily studied with nicotine than with many other drugs.

To identify the site of this stimulatory action, simultaneous microdialysis was performed in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the ipsilateral nucleus accumbens (NAC) of awake rats. Extracellular concentrations of DA and its metabolites were measured in the NAC. NIC (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) increased DA and its metabolites by approximately 50%. Concomitant infusion of the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine (MEC, 100 microM) through the VTA probe, starting 40 min before NIC injection, antagonized the NIC induced increases of DA and its metabolites. In contrast, similar MEC pretreatment (40 or 140 min) in the NAC did not affect DA or metabolite responses to systemic NIC. Infusion of NIC (1,000 microM) in the NAC or the VTA increased DA release by 49% and 48%, respectively, whereas only the VTA infusion increased metabolite concentrations by approximately 25%. MEC infusion (1-1,000 microM) in the VTA did not affect DA or its metabolites, whereas the 1,000 microM concentration infused in the NAC increased DA by 77%. These results suggest that nicotinic receptors in the somatodendritic region may be of greater importance than those located in the terminal area for the stimulatory action of systemic NIC on the mesolimbic DA system.

The evidence is divided, however, about the direction of causal association. One argument is that a Reward Deficiency Syndrome is the risk factor, while others contend that hyper-sensitivity to reward enhances the motivation for pleasurable activities like eating. Unfortunately, little human research has bridged the gap between psychological and neurobiological approaches to brain reward functioning and disorder. The present study addressed this issue by implementing psychological and biological markers of reward sensitivity in the assessment protocol. METHODS: Adults with binge eating disorder (BED) were compared to samples of normal-weight and obese controls on two personality measures of reward sensitivity and were genotyped for six markers of the DRD2 dopamine receptor gene. RESULTS: Genotype x Group ANOVAs revealed significant main effects and an interaction on the personality measures for Taq1A. BED and obese subjects reported greater reward sensitivity than normal-weight controls, but only among those carrying the A1 allele. We also found that normal-weight controls with at least one copy of the T allele of the C957T marker had significantly lower reward sensitivity scores than any of the other groups who did not differ from each other. CONCLUSIONS: Given evidence linking the A1 allele with reduced receptor density, an inverse relationship was expected between psychological measures of reward sensitivity and presence of the A1 allele. One explanation for our findings could be that the BED and obese participants possess another genetic variant that interacts with the A1 allele to produce higher dopamine activity. These findings have implications for future studies of the molecular genetics of BED and obesity, and for behavioural and pharmacologic therapies targeting these conditions.","Reward sensitivity and the D2 dopamine receptor gene: A case-control study of binge eating disorder.","Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry","Davis C and Levitan RD and Kaplan AS and Carter J and Reid C and Curtis C and Patte K and Hwang R and Kennedy JL","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-30 11:53:29,-1,2021-04-02 16:44:28,,,,,,,,

Recent advances using animal models of relapse have shown that drug-seeking behaviour can be triggered by drug-associated cues, by stress and by 'priming' injections of the drugs themselves, events also known to trigger drug craving in human drug addicts. Current evidence suggests that these stimuli all induce relapse, at least in part, by their common ability to activate the mesolimbic dopamine system. Drug-associated cues and stress can activate this system via neural circuits from the prefrontal cortex and amygdala and through activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Our studies suggest that dopamine triggers relapse to drug-seeking behaviour by stimulating D2-dopamine receptors which inhibit the cyclic AMP second messenger pathway in the neurones of the nucleus accumbens. In contrast, compounds which activate D1 receptors prevent relapse to drug-seeking behaviour, possibly through satiation of reward pathways. Chronic neuroadaptations in dopamine receptor signalling pathways in the nucleus accumbens caused by repeated drug use are hypothesized to produce tolerance to the rewarding effects of D1-receptor stimulation, leading to increased drug intake during drug self-administration. Conversely, these same neuroadaptations are hypothesized to enhance drug craving by potentiating D2 receptor-mediated signals during abstinence. These findings identify D1 and D2-dopamine receptor mechanisms as potential targets for developing anticraving compounds to treat drug addiction.","Neural substrates of drug craving and relapse in drug addiction.","Annals of medicine","Self DW","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-30 11:53:36,-1,2021-04-02 16:46:04,,,,,,,,

Rats self-administered cocaine under a continuous reinforcement schedule in which a response on one of two identical levers led to an intravenous cocaine infusion (0.25 mg/infusion) and a 20 sec light CS+. Response requirements for cocaine and the CS+ were then progressively increased until stable responding was established under a second-order schedule of reinforcement. During microdialysis, rats were presented noncontingently with a set of 10 sec CS+ and neutral tone stimuli (CS-) before and after a 90 min period during which they responded for cocaine under a second-order schedule. Results showed the following: (1) nucleus accumbens DA increased in both the core and shell during intravenous cocaine self-administration; (2) noncontingent presentations of a cocaine-associated CS+ led to increased DA release selectively in the nucleus accumbens core; and (3) extracellular DA levels were unaltered in both core and shell during a protracted period of drug-seeking behavior under the control of the same cocaine-associated cue.

This phenomenon, termed behavioral sensitization, is thought to underlie certain aspects of drug addiction. Behavioral sensitization is the consequence of drug-induced neuroadaptive changes in a circuit involving dopaminergic and glutamatergic interconnections between the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex and amygdala. METHODS: The literature was critically reviewed in an effort to discern the relative roles of glutamate and dopamine transmission in the induction and expression of sensitization to amphetamine, cocaine and mu-opioids. In addition, the literature was reviewed to evaluate distinctions between these drugs in the involvement of the relevant brain nuclei listed above. RESULTS: The common substrates between sensitizing drugs are glutamate transmission, especially at the NMDA receptor, and an action in the ventral tegmental area. In contrast, a role for dopamine is only clearly seen in amphetamine sensitization and critical involvement of nuclei outside the ventral tegmental area is found for cocaine and morphine. While enhanced dopamine transmission is associated with sensitization by all three drugs, a role for glutamate is clearly identified only with cocaine sensitization. Accordingly, glutamatergic cortical and allocortical brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex appear more critical for cocaine sensitization. CONCLUSIONS: The distinctions between drugs in the induction and expression of sensitization indicate that behavioral sensitization can arise from multiple neuroadaptations in multiple brain nuclei. This is not only the result of distinct molecular targets for the drugs, but may also include a differential involvement of learned associations. It is postulated that the relatively more robust pharmacological capacity of amphetamine to release dopamine may induce a form of sensitization that is more dependent on adaptations in mesoaccumbens dopamine transmission compared with cocaine and morphine sensitization.","Alterations in dopaminergic and glutamatergic transmission in the induction and expression of behavioral sensitization: a critical review of preclinical studies.","Psychopharmacology","Vanderschuren LJ and Kalivas PW","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-30 11:56:37,-1,2021-04-02 16:47:19,,,,,,,,

Male Fischer rats were injected with saline or cocaine (15 mg/kg) three times daily at 1-hr intervals at the beginning of the light cycle to approximate the manner in which cocaine is often abused by humans both in terms of temporal pattern and in relation to circadian rhythm. Cocaine administered in this binge-like regimen produced an increase in locomotor activity during each hour postinjection. The increase in activity was significantly greater on the 13th day of drug administration than on the first day indicating sensitization to the locomotor-activating effects of cocaine. D1 and D2 dopamine receptors were measured after 2, 7 and 14 days of saline or cocaine injections using quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography. Up-regulation of D1 receptors occurred in the olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum and substantia nigra after 14 days of cocaine treatment. Transient increases in D2 receptor number were found in the olfactory tubercle, rostral nucleus accumbens and rostral caudate putamen after 7 days of cocaine injections which returned to baseline levels after 14 days of cocaine treatment. The temporal pattern of receptor up-regulation suggests that D1 receptors are involved in the development of behavioral sensitization to cocaine.","Time course of the development of behavioral sensitization and dopamine receptor up-regulation during binge cocaine administration.","The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics","Unterwald EM and Ho A and Rubenfeld JM and Kreek MJ","Drug-related intermittent or continuous access",-1,,-1,2021-03-30 11:56:58,-1,2021-04-02 16:47:11,,,,,,,,

Although there are several potential explanations for this dramatic increase in obesity, dietary influences are a contributing factor. An inverse correlation between dietary sugar intake and body mass index has been reported, suggesting beneficial effects of carbohydrate intake on body mass index. In this review we discuss how sugars interact with regulatory neurochemicals in the brain to affect both energy intake and energy expenditure. These neurochemicals appear to be involved in dietary selection, and sugars and palatable substances affect neurochemical changes in the brain. For example, rats that drink sucrose solutions for 3 wk have major changes in neuronal activity in the limbic area of the brain, a region involved in pleasure and other emotions. We also investigate the relations between sucrose (and other sweet substances), drugs of abuse, and the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. The presence of sucrose in an animal's cage can affect the animals desire to self-administer drugs of abuse. Also, an animal's level of sucrose preference can predict its desire to self-administer cocaine. Such data suggest a relation between sweet taste and drug reward, although the relevance to humans is unclear. Finally, we address the influence of sugar on body weight control. For example, sucrose feeding for 2 wk decreases the efficiency of energy utilization and increases gene expression of uncoupling protein 3 in muscle, suggesting that sucrose may influence uncoupling protein 3 activity and contribute to changes in metabolic efficiency and thus regulation of body weight.","Sugars: hedonic aspects, neuroregulation, and energy balance.","The American journal of clinical nutrition","Levine AS and Kotz CM and Gosnell BA","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-30 11:57:06,-1,2021-04-02 16:48:27,,,,,,,,

We examined the influence of functional genetic variants in DAT1 on cocaine addiction. Repeat polymorphisms, including a 30-bp variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) in intron 8 (Int8 VNTR) with two common alleles, were genotyped in cocaine-dependent abusers (n = 699) and in controls with no past history of drug abuse (n = 866) from Sao Paulo, Brazil. Positive association was observed with allele 3 of the Int8 VNTR and cocaine abuse (allele odds ratio = 1.2, 95% confidence interval = 1.01-1.37, P = 0.036; 3/3 homozygote odds ratio = 1.45, 95% confidence interval = 1.18-1.78, P = 0.0008). Population stratification was assessed and did not affect the results. Haplotypic analyses using additional polymorphisms indicated that the Int8 VNTR is responsible for the observed association. Functional analyses in reporter-gene constructs, demonstrated that allele 3 mediates significant (P < 0.05) but small reduced expression compared with the 'protective' allele 2. This difference increased when 1 and 10 muM cocaine was added to the cell culture ( approximately 40% reduction of the 3 allele expression versus the 2 allele). The 3 allele also demonstrated approximately 3-fold-increased expression over the 2 allele in response to KCl plus forskolin challenge. We demonstrate a robust association between cocaine dependence and a VNTR allele in SLC6A3, conferring a small but detectable effect, and we show that this VNTR may be functional.

Prior research suggests that dopamine (DA) input to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) motivates behavior, and a component of that motivation circuit includes hypothalamic feeding systems. Acetylcholine (ACh) in the NAc, on the other hand, may act in part to inhibit feeding and generate satiety. If so, 5-HT and/or CCK in the PVN should lower extracellular DA or release ACh in the NAc. Rats were prepared with microdialysis probes in the NAc and injectors in the PVN. Serotonin (7.75 microg) or CCK-8 (0.12 microg) injected in the PVN significantly decreased ipsilateral accumbens DA (63 and 73% of baseline, respectively, without effect on ACh). However, 5-HT plus CCK injected in combination decreased DA to 72% (P<0.001) and simultaneously increased extracellular ACh to 128% of baseline (P<0.001). In later tests with the same doses and the same animals, unilateral PVN injections of 5-HT, CCK, or both combined, significantly inhibited food intake in the early dark period. The results suggest that 5-HT in the PVN acts as a neural modulator that primes a hypothalamic satiation system to respond to CCK when the gastrointestinal tract contains food to be digested. The synergistic action of 5-HT plus phasic CCK may then activate a circuit that simultaneously limits DA and releases ACh in the accumbens as part of the satiation process.","Cholecystokinin combined with serotonin in the hypothalamus limits accumbens dopamine release while increasing acetylcholine: a possible satiation mechanism.","Brain research","Helm KA and Rada P and Hoebel BG","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-30 11:59:05,-1,2021-04-02 16:49:09,,,,,,,,

Behavioral augmentation also has been shown with opioids such as morphine, and it is known that a stimulant action on dopaminergic perikarya in the ventromedial mesencephalon is critical to the development of behavioral sensitization to morphine. To determine if amphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization might also involve the mesencephalic dopamine neurons, amphetamine was microinjected daily for 2 days into regions of the rat brain containing dopamine cell bodies (A10 and A9 dopamine regions), or dopamine terminals (nucleus accumbens and striatum), and 6 days later amphetamine was given peripherally. It was found that daily amphetamine injection into the A10 or A9 dopamine region, but not into the dopamine terminal fields, significantly potentiated the motor stimulant effect of peripherally administered amphetamine. The behavioral sensitization produced by intracranial injection of amphetamine was found to be dose-dependent. Intra-A10 injection of amphetamine also was found to potentiate the motor stimulant effect of peripheral cocaine.

Glucose and mannose each promoted insulin synthesis and secretion. Mannose at 1,200 mg/dl produced synthesis-secretion coupling similar to glucose at 200 mg/dl. Fructose alone at 1,200 mg/dl failed to cause any significant release of insulin, but it did significantly increase beta cell insulin content. When mannose and fructose were combined at 600 mg/dl each, in the absence of glucose, they resulted in a synergistic effect on insulin secretion and an additive effect on insulinogenesis, which was in excess of, or equal to, the insulinotropic effect of glucose at 300 mg/dl. These results clearly establish that the synthesis and secretion of insulin can be uncoupled. Mannose primarily stimulates the putative beta cell glucoreceptor, and fructose signals the insulin biosynthetic pathway. When combined, these monosaccharides couple synthesis-secretion of insulin comparable to glucose. The data suggest that the uncoupling of insulin secretion and synthesis, which may contribute either independently or in combination to abnormalities in pancreatic function observed in various diabetic conditions can be studied using the isolated perfused pancreas model.

However, the clinical practice and epidemiological data clearly show that weight control is more complex than expected by this simple equation. This is particularly true in morbid obesity, a form of severe obesity in which a person's Body Mass Index (BMI, kg/m(2)) is over 40. If we compare the definitions and diagnostic criteria for 'dependence' and 'addiction' with the situation of many severe obese subjects, it is apparent that they match very well. Further, different neurological studies confirm this similarity: both addiction and obesity patients have a deficiency of dopamine receptors. Nevertheless, when we compare many of the actual obesity treatments with the ones used in the area of addictions it is possible to find relevant differences: obesity treatments neither consider different levels of type and intensity of care, nor a multidimensional approach. To overcome these limitations, in this paper we propose a bio-psychosocial approach in which the genetic influence (lack of dopamine receptors) is matched by psychosocial issues (pressure for thinness and diet as main body image dissatisfaction treatment). Further, the paper outlines how this approach may influence the treatment options, by focusing both on the lessons coming from actual addiction treatment and the opportunities offered by virtual reality.

The receptors which may be involved in opioid-feeding relationships are discussed. Relationships between the endogenous opioid system and other systems, such as the dopaminergic, noradrenergic and hormonal systems, are considered insofar as they may have bearing on the modulation of feeding behaviour. Finally, three theories are briefly outlined which attempt to link the endogenous opioid system with feeding modulation and the pathogenesis of certain eating disorders. The suggestion is put forward that anorexia nervosa may represent a pathological consequence of the triggering of a primitive mechanism for coping with unforeseen food shortages which may have short-term advantages, e.g., for masking or temporarily alleviating a depressed state.","Opioid involvement in feeding behaviour and the pathogenesis of certain eating disorders.","Medical hypotheses","Johnson RD","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-30 12:23:52,-1,2021-04-02 16:52:42,,,,,,,,

Although opiate blockade is not a viable strategy for weight reduction in the treatment of obesity, it may be useful in the clinical management of the binge-eating disorder.","Naloxone, an opiate blocker, reduces the consumption of sweet high-fat foods in obese and lean female binge eaters.","The American journal of clinical nutrition","Drewnowski A and Krahn DD and Demitrack MA and Nairn K and Gosnell BA","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-30 12:24:25,-1,2021-04-02 16:54:13,,,,,,,,

This study determined if ad libitum Chow-fed rats can learn CPPs when given relatively brief exposures to different solid snack foods (SFs) -- one high in sugar (Froot Loops cereal: FL) vs. one high in fat (Cheetos: C). Two groups of 16 male rats were trained during 20-min sessions to eat either FL or C in one side of a three-chambered CPP apparatus vs. Chow in the opposite side on alternating days for 20 days. Rats ate considerably more SFs of both types than Chow during the conditioning sessions (SFs: about 23 kcal versus Chow: about 7 kcal). Ten-minute tests for CPPs in the absence of SFs showed that the time spent on SF-conditioned sides increased significantly compared to pre-conditioning tests. Analyses of variance for re-tested CCPs after 0.1, 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0mg/kg NAL showed dose-dependent suppressions of CPPs to both SFs. These data show that consuming sweet or fatty SFs can become reliably associated with environmental cues in the non-deprived state.

However, the regional neurochemical mechanism of the binge eating is poorly understood. Our purpose was to elucidate brain neurochemical mechanisms of binge eating using a rat model. METHODS: The dopamine release and metabolism in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and in the ventrolateral striatum (VLS) of rats were studied using microdialysis during enhanced rebound hyperphagia induced by space restriction (an animal model of binge eating). RESULTS: The rats showed rebound hyperphagic state when they were released from scheduled feeding (2 hours/day feeding for 7 days). The hyperphagia was further enhanced when they were put in a space-restricted cage where their mobility was restricted. Dopamine release and metabolism were increased both in the PFC and in the VLS during the enhanced rebound hyperphagia. CONCLUSIONS: These results tentatively suggest that increased dopamine release and metabolism in the PFC and in the VLS may be related to space restriction and to activation of motor function involved in feeding behavior, respectively. The enhanced rebound hyperphagia induced by space restriction may be useful as an animal model of binge eating.","Prefrontal and striatal dopamine metabolism during enhanced rebound hyperphagia induced by space restriction--a rat model of binge eating.","Biological psychiatry","Inoue K and Kiriike N and Okuno M and Fujisaki Y and Kurioka M and Iwasaki S and Yamagami S","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-30 12:24:52,-1,2021-04-02 16:54:40,,,,,,,,

The majority of the collected data related to opioids and feeding has led to the speculation that opioids are involved in meal maintenance and orosensory reward; however, some data suggest that opioids may impact feeding associated with energy needs. Based on the wide distribution of CNS opioid receptors and the presence of other neuropeptides in the vicinity of opioidergic pathways, it seems likely that opioids affect multiple feeding systems. For example, opioids in the hindbrain might be involved in both sensory and metabolic aspects of food intake, those in the amygdala in processing of 'emotional' properties of foods, and those in the hypothalamus in energy needs.

The initial lever presses of each session caused elevations in DA concentration, usually to an initial peak that was not maintained throughout the rest of the session. As the initial ('loading') injections were metabolized, DA levels dropped toward baseline but were sustained at elevated plateaus by subsequent lever pressing that was spaced throughout the remainder of the 3 hr sessions. During this period, DA levels fluctuated phasically, time-locked to the cycle of periodic lever pressing. Consistent with the known pharmacological actions and dynamics of amphetamine, peak DA elevations were seen approximately 10-15 min after each injection, and the mean DA level was at a low point in the phasic cycle at the time of each new lever press. During extinction periods when saline was substituted for amphetamine, DA levels dropped steadily toward baseline levels despite a dramatic increase in (now-unrewarded) lever pressing. Noncontingent injections during extinction reinstated lever-pressing behavior and increased nucleus accumbens DA concentrations. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that under the conditions of this experiment-during periods of amphetamine intoxication in well-trained animals-the timing of amphetamine self-administration comes primarily under the control of extracellular DA concentrations. The probability of lever pressing during the maintenance phase is highest when DA concentrations fall near a characteristic trigger point, a trigger point that is significantly elevated above baseline, and falls as DA concentrations fall below or increase above that trigger point.","Dopamine fluctuations in the nucleus accumbens during maintenance, extinction, and reinstatement of intravenous D-amphetamine self-administration.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Ranaldi R and Pocock D and Zereik R and Wise RA","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-31 15:43:42,-1,2021-04-02 16:56:41,,,,,,,,

Their relative importance in this respect under normal physiological conditions is unclear, however, and the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate this. Eight healthy male volunteers (mean age: 23 (range 20-25) years; mean body mass index: 22.2 (range 19.3-25.4) kg/m2) participated in studies involving stepwise glucose clamping at fasting plasma glucose levels and at 6 and 7 mmol/l. Physiological amounts of either GIP (1.5 pmol/kg/min), GLP-1(7-36)amide (0.33 pmol/kg/min) or saline were infused for three periods of 30 min at each glucose level, with 1 h 'washout' between the infusions. On a separate day, a standard meal test (566 kcal) was performed. During the meal test, peak insulin concentrations were observed after 30 min and amounted to 223+/-27 pmol/l. Glucose+saline infusions induced only minor increases in insulin concentrations. GLP-1 and GIP infusions induced significant and similar increases at fasting glucose levels and at 6 mmol/l. At 7 mmol/l, further increases were seen, with GLP-1 effects exceeding those of GIP. Insulin concentrations at the end of the three infusion periods (60, 150 and 240 min) during the GIP clamp amounted to 53+/-5, 79+/-8 and 113+/-15 pmol/l, respectively. Corresponding results were 47+/-7, 95+/-10 and 171+/-21 pmol/l, respectively, during the GLP-1 clamp. C-peptide responses were similar. Total and intact incretin hormone concentrations during the clamp studies were higher compared to the meal test, but within physiological limits. Glucose infusion alone significantly inhibited glucagon secretion, which was further inhibited by GLP-1 but not by GIP infusion. We conclude that during normal physiological plasma glucose levels, glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide contribute nearly equally to the incretin effect in humans, because their differences in concentration and potency outweigh each other.","Both GLP-1 and GIP are insulinotropic at basal and postprandial glucose levels and contribute nearly equally to the incretin effect of a meal in healthy subjects.","Regulatory peptides","Vilsboll T and Krarup T and Madsbad S and Holst JJ","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-31 15:43:55,-1,2021-04-02 16:59:53,,,,,,,,

In this review the authors explore how advances in neurobiology are approaching an understanding of the cellular and circuitry underpinnings of addiction, and they describe the novel pharmacotherapeutic targets emerging from this understanding. METHOD: Findings from neuroimaging of addicts are integrated with cellular studies in animal models of drug seeking. RESULTS: While dopamine is critical for acute reward and initiation of addiction, end-stage addiction results primarily from cellular adaptations in anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal glutamatergic projections to the nucleus accumbens. Pathophysiological plasticity in excitatory transmission reduces the capacity of the prefrontal cortex to initiate behaviors in response to biological rewards and to provide executive control over drug seeking. Simultaneously, the prefrontal cortex is hyperresponsive to stimuli predicting drug availability, resulting in supraphysiological glutamatergic drive in the nucleus accumbens, where excitatory synapses have a reduced capacity to regulate neurotransmission. CONCLUSIONS: Cellular adaptations in prefrontal glutamatergic innervation of the accumbens promote the compulsive character of drug seeking in addicts by decreasing the value of natural rewards, diminishing cognitive control (choice), and enhancing glutamatergic drive in response to drug-associated stimuli.","The neural basis of addiction: a pathology of motivation and choice.","The American journal of psychiatry","Kalivas PW and Volkow ND","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-31 15:44:12,-1,2021-04-02 17:00:20,,,,,,,,

Here, we review briefly the history of the model and describe the different procedures that have been used to study the phenomenon of reinstatement of drug seeking. The results from studies using pharmacological and neuroanatomical techniques to determine the neuronal events that mediate reinstatement of heroin, cocaine and alcohol seeking by acute priming injections of drugs, drug-associated cues and environmental stressors are summarized. In addition, several issues are discussed, including (1) the concordance between the neuronal mechanisms involved in drug-induced reinstatement and those involved in drug reward and discrimination, (2) the role of drug withdrawal states and periods in reinstatement of drug seeking, (3) the role of neuronal adaptations induced by exposure to drugs in relapse, and (4) the degree to which the rat reinstatement model provides a suitable preclinical model of relapse to drug taking. CONCLUSIONS: The data derived from studies using the reinstatement model suggest that the neuronal events that mediate drug-, cue- and stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking are not identical, that the mechanisms underlying drug-induced reinstatement are to some degree different from those mediating drug discrimination or reward, and that the duration of the withdrawal period following cocaine and heroin self-administration has a profound effect on reinstatement induced by drug cues and stress. Finally, there appears to be a good correspondence between the events that induce reinstatement in laboratory animals and those that provoke relapse in humans.","The reinstatement model of drug relapse: history, methodology and major findings.","Psychopharmacology","Shaham Y and Shalev U and Lu L and de Wit H and Stewart J","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-31 15:44:45,-1,2021-04-02 17:01:26,,,,,,,,

To test this hypothesis, the effects of two nicotinic receptor antagonists and of subchronic nicotine treatment on voluntary ethanol consumption (ethanol 6% v/v or water) were studied in ethanol low-, medium- or high-preferring Wistar rats. After systemic mecamylamine (2 mg/kg) but not hexamethonium (0 mg/kg) high- but not low-preferring rats decreased their ethanol intake but, however, not their ethanol preference. When subchronically exposed to nicotine (0.35 mg/kg, s.c. daily) medium-preferring rats markedly increased their ethanol intake and preference. This effect lasted for more than 1 week after interrupting nicotine administration. Ethanol intake levels did not correlate with locomotor activity scores after nicotine challenge (0.35 mg/kg, s.c.) or with exploratory locomotor activity. However, exploratory locomotor activity correlated with locomotor activity scores both after nicotine (0.35 mg/kg, s.c.) and ethanol (0.125 g/kg i.p.) challenge.

The present results further implicate central nicotinic receptors in the molecular events mediating the reinforcing properties of ethanol, and suggest that subchronic nicotine enhances the responsiveness of mesolimbic dopamine neurons both to nicotine and to ethanol.

RESULTS: Signal detection analysis indicated a single pathway that identified approximately 13% of the BED/BN cases. The pathway was based on an elevated level of perceived stress prior to the age of 14. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that eating disorders may have multiple and complex etiologies.

Three rhesus monkeys intravenously self-administered an average of 1.35 mg/kg cocaine per day for 18-22 months until they were euthanized immediately after a self-administration session. Binding site density of the D2 ligand [3H]raclopride (2 nM) was assessed in these monkeys as well as three untreated controls, using quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography. As compared to untreated controls, D2 binding site density was significantly lower in the animals that self-administered cocaine in all regions of the striatum rostral to the anterior commissure. These regions include the anterior and central regions of the caudate nucleus, putamen, olfactory tubercle, and both the shell and core of the nucleus accumbens. Within the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area, by contrast, no differences were found in the density of D2 binding sites. These findings suggest a pervasive effect of cocaine on the regulation of D2 receptors in the striatum. The lack of change within the ventral midbrain, however, suggests a differential regulation of D2 receptors in the striatum and ventral midbrain.

Using the same CPP apparatus and procedures, two genetic sub-strains of SD rats, one selectively bred for diet-induced obesity (DIO) vs. another bred for diet resistance to obesity (DR), were used in this investigation. The experiment determined if (a) CPPs can be created in both strains using the same high-caloric 'snack foods' and, (b) if CPPs existed, were they opioid dependent. Four non-deprived groups of eight male rats, half being of each strain, were given 20 min sessions to eat either FL or C in one side of a three-chamber CPP apparatus vs. chow on the opposite side over alternating days of a 20 day period. Each predetermined side had distinctly different environmental cues. Following conditioning, rats were tested during 10 min sessions to see if CPPs existed to the 'snack food' trained sides. During conditioning and testing, bodyweights, intakes of foods, and activity were measured. Both FL and C generated strong CPPs that were equivalent in both strains. In contrast to our previous study in the parent strain, doses of 0, 0.50, 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 mg/kg of the opioid antagonist, naltrexone, had no effect on blocking these CPPs. These results show that (a) DIO and DR rats can learn CPPs (i.e., 'exhibit food cravings') as well as their parent strain after periodic access to high-caloric palatable foods, but imply that (b) some physiological system other than the endogenous opioid system mediates such learning.","Conditioned place preferences (CPPs) to high-caloric 'snack foods' in rat strains genetically prone vs. resistant to diet-induced obesity: resistance to naltrexone blockade.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior","Jarosz PA and Kessler JT and Sekhon P and Coscina DV","",-1,2021-04-11 19:37:51,0,2021-03-31 15:46:24,-1,2021-04-02 17:03:17,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: The goal was to test the hypothesis that acute nicotine decreases extracellular ACh and increases extracellular dopamine (DA) in the NAc, while withdrawal from nicotine causes an opposite neurochemical imbalance with high extracellular ACh and low DA. METHODS: Rats were prepared with a microdialysis probe in the NAc (primarily the shell region). They received one injection of nicotine (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) or chronic nicotine (9 mg/kg per day via osmotic minipump). RESULTS: Naive animals receiving acute nicotine showed a mild, significant increase in both ACh (122% of baseline) and DA (124%). After chronic nicotine administration for 7 days, the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine (1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) precipitated withdrawal with the appearance of somatic signs (teeth chattering and shakes/tremors) and a significant increase in extracellular ACh to 125% of baseline, while extracellular DA decreased to 65%. Control groups receiving saline in place of nicotine or mecamylamine did not show these effects. CONCLUSIONS: Earlier work suggests that the observed release of accumbens ACh and DA in response to acute nicotine administration may be a factor in nicotine-induced suppression of appetite. ACh release during withdrawal, coupled with the decrease in extracellular DA may play a role in the aversive aspects of nicotine withdrawal that contribute to dependency.","Effects of nicotine and mecamylamine-induced withdrawal on extracellular dopamine and acetylcholine in the rat nucleus accumbens.","Psychopharmacology","Rada P and Jensen K and Hoebel BG","Drug-related intermittent or continuous access",-1,,-1,2021-03-31 15:47:19,-1,2021-04-02 17:23:06,,,,,,,,

However, outside of the laboratory, nutritional inadequacy is often confounded with dietary monotony. Therefore, one aim was to examine the effects of a nutritionally adequate, liquid, sweet, monotonous diet on food cravings in young and elderly adults. In addition, previous retrospective questionnaire work has indicated that elderly individuals report fewer food cravings than do young adults. Because there are possible age differences in cognitive capacity, another goal of this work was to develop a prospective method (i.e.. a method that depends less on memory) of studying cravings that permits comparison of adults of different ages. Young adults reported significantly more cravings per day during the monotony manipulation than during the baseline period. Therefore, nutritional deprivation is not a necessary condition for food cravings. There were no gender differences. The increase was due primarily to a greater number of cravings for entrees (i.e., foods that differed in sensory quality from the monotonous diet). Cravings for sweets did not change. In contrast to predictions that liking for the monotonous diet would decline as a result of 'repetition revulsion,' there was no significant change in liking for the diet over the study period. In contrast to the young adults, elderly subjects were not responsive to the monotony manipulation. Elderly men reported almost no cravings at any time during the study. Elderly women reported as many cravings as did young adults during the baseline period, but did not show an increase in cravings during the monotony period.

To identify the mechanism of these long-lasting processes, we checked the density of mu opioid receptors, receptor-G-protein coupling and the cyclic AMP (cAMP) cascade. In morphine-sensitized animals mu opioid receptor autoradiography revealed a significant increase in the caudate putamen (30% versus controls), nucleus accumbens shell (16%), prefrontal and frontal cortex (26%), medial thalamus (43%), hypothalamus (200%) and central gray (89%). Concerning morphine's activation of G proteins in the brain, investigated in the guanylyl 5'-[gamma-(35)S]thio]triphosphate ([(35)S]GTPgammaS) binding assay, a significant increase in net [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding was seen in the caudate putamen (39%) and hypothalamus (27%). In the caudate putamen this was due to an increase in the amount of activated G proteins, and in the hypothalamus to a greater affinity of G proteins for guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The main second messenger system linked to the opioid receptor is the cAMP pathway. In the striatum basal cAMP levels were significantly elevated in sensitized animals (70% versus controls) and [D-Ala(2), N-Me-Phe(4), Gly(5)-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) significantly inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in control (30%) but not in sensitized rats.

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Subjects were 145 consecutive outpatients with BED as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4(th) edition. Subjects were interviewed and they completed questionnaires to assess eating disorder features and functioning. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire was given to assess childhood maltreatment in five domains (emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional neglect, and physical neglect). RESULTS: A total of 83% of BED patients reported some form of childhood maltreatment. A total of 59% of BED patients reported emotional abuse, 36% reported physical abuse, 30% reported sexual abuse, 69% reported emotional neglect, and 49% reported physical neglect. There were no differences in the distribution of any form of childhood maltreatment by gender or by obesity status. The different forms of maltreatment were not associated with variability in current body mass index, binge eating, or in the attitudinal features of eating disorders. Only one of the five forms of maltreatment (physical neglect) was associated with dietary restraint in women. Emotional abuse was significantly associated with greater body dissatisfaction, higher depression, and lower self-esteem in men and women and sexual abuse was associated with greater body dissatisfaction in men. The different forms of maltreatment were unrelated to the age at onset of overweight, dieting, or binge eating. DISCUSSION: BED outpatients reported a wide range of childhood experiences of maltreatment that do not differ by gender or obesity status. Different forms of maltreatment were not associated with the onset of overweight, dieting, or binge eating, or with variability in current body mass index or eating disorder features (except for one association between physical neglect and dietary restraint).

The mesenteric and subcutaneous fat accumulations were closely related to hyperinsulinemia in the portal vein and inferior vena cava, respectively. Twelve weeks of high sucrose feeding caused accumulation of abdominal adipose tissue with marked hyperinsulinemia and hyperlipidemia.

Opiate peptides (enkephalin), and brain-gut peptides (neurotensin and CCK) influence feeding and satiety when injected in the hypothalamus and reinforce behavior when injected in the midbrain. Locomotor stimulants (amphetamine and phencyclidine) reinforce behavior by an action in the nucleus accumbens.

In addition, individuals with ICD were more likely to have obsessive-compulsive disorder, any anxiety disorder, specific phobia, depression, cluster B personality disorder, avoidant personality disorder, and to use psychoactive substances. Among those with ICD, 62% reported the ICD predated the eating disorder and 45% reported the onset of both disorders within the same 3-year window.

Understanding the dual aspects of food reward could throw light on food choice, appetite control and overconsumption. The present study reports the development of a procedure to measure these processes in humans. A computer-based paradigm was used to assess 'liking' (through pleasantness ratings) and 'wanting' (through forced-choice photographic procedure) for foods that varied in fat (high or low) and taste (savoury or sweet). 60 participants completed the program when hungry and after an ad libitum meal. Findings indicate a state (hungry-satiated)-dependent, partial dissociation between 'liking' and 'wanting' for generic food categories. In the hungry state, participants 'wanted' high-fat savoury>low-fat savoury with no corresponding difference in 'liking', and 'liked' high-fat sweet>low-fat sweet but did not differ in 'wanting' for these foods. In the satiated state, participants 'liked', but did not 'want', high-fat savoury>low-fat savoury, and 'wanted' but did not 'like' low-fat sweet>high-fat sweet. More differences in 'liking' and 'wanting' were observed when hungry than when satiated. This procedure provides the first step in proof of concept that 'liking' and 'wanting' can be dissociated in humans and can be further developed for foods varying along different dimensions. Other experimental procedures may also be devised to separate 'liking' and 'wanting'.","Is it possible to dissociate 'liking' and 'wanting' for foods in humans?

One synapse on, in the orbitofrontal cortex, these sensory inputs are for some neurons combined by learning with olfactory and visual inputs. Different neurons respond to different combinations, providing a rich representation of the sensory properties of food. In the orbitofrontal cortex, feeding to satiety with one food decreases the responses of these neurons to that food, but not to other foods, showing that sensory-specific satiety is computed in the primate (including human) orbitofrontal cortex. Consistently, activation of parts of the human orbitofrontal cortex correlates with subjective ratings of the pleasantness of the taste and smell of food. Cognitive factors, such as a word label presented with an odour, influence the pleasantness of the odour and the activation produced by the odour in the orbitofrontal cortex. These findings provide a basis for understanding how what is in the mouth is represented by independent information channels in the brain; how the information from these channels is combined; and how and where the reward and subjective affective value of food is represented and is influenced by satiety signals. Activation of these representations in the orbitofrontal cortex may provide the goal for eating, and understanding them helps to provide a basis for understanding appetite and its disorders.","Brain mechanisms underlying flavour and appetite.","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Opioids may also be involved in alcohol intake, as there is a positive correlation between alcohol drinking and preference for sweets and fats. Our previous studies have shown that mu opioid stimulation of the nucleus accumbens preferentially augments intake of palatable food containing sucrose and fat. OBJECTIVE: The first goal of the present study was to further explore the nature of the involvement of mu opioids within the nucleus accumbens in ingestive behavior by investigating the importance of orosensory reward in opioid-mediated feeding, using non-caloric tasty substances (saccharin and salt). Second, we investigated whether mu opioid receptors within the nucleus accumbens also regulate alcohol consumption. METHODS: The mu agonist, D-Ala2, NMe-Phe4, Glyol5-enkephalin (DAMGO; 0, 0.025 and 0.25 microg/0.5 microl per side), was microinfused into the nucleus accumbens, and intake of 0.6% saline, 0.15% sodium saccharin, water, and 6% ethanol was measured. RESULTS: Microinfusion of DAMGO into the nucleus accumbens increased the drinking of salt and saccharin solutions in non-deprived rats. However, water intake was not increased by this treatment in water-deprived rats. Mu opioid stimulation of the nucleus accumbens also augmented ethanol intake in rats not deprived of fluid, while leaving water intake unchanged when water was concurrently available. CONCLUSION: These results provide evidence to suggest that the mu opioid system within the ventral striatum regulates ingestive behavior via a mechanism related to the hedonic assessment of taste. In addition, the nucleus accumbens may be a key brain area where ethanol interacts with endogenous opioid systems, and thus may be a common neural substrate for both food palatability and alcohol drinking.","Intake of saccharin, salt, and ethanol solutions is increased by infusion of a mu opioid agonist into the nucleus accumbens.","Psychopharmacology","Zhang M and Kelley AE","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-31 15:57:13,-1,2021-04-02 17:29:19,,,,,,,,

In this article, we investigate the relation between the intake of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) and the development of obesity. We analyzed food consumption patterns by using US Department of Agriculture food consumption tables from 1967 to 2000. The consumption of HFCS increased > 1000% between 1970 and 1990, far exceeding the changes in intake of any other food or food group. HFCS now represents > 40% of caloric sweeteners added to foods and beverages and is the sole caloric sweetener in soft drinks in the United States. Our most conservative estimate of the consumption of HFCS indicates a daily average of 132 kcal for all Americans aged > or = 2 y, and the top 20% of consumers of caloric sweeteners ingest 316 kcal from HFCS/d. The increased use of HFCS in the United States mirrors the rapid increase in obesity. The digestion, absorption, and metabolism of fructose differ from those of glucose. Hepatic metabolism of fructose favors de novo lipogenesis. In addition, unlike glucose, fructose does not stimulate insulin secretion or enhance leptin production. Because insulin and leptin act as key afferent signals in the regulation of food intake and body weight, this suggests that dietary fructose may contribute to increased energy intake and weight gain. Furthermore, calorically sweetened beverages may enhance caloric overconsumption. Thus, the increase in consumption of HFCS has a temporal relation to the epidemic of obesity, and the overconsumption of HFCS in calorically sweetened beverages may play a role in the epidemic of obesity.","Consumption of high-fructose corn syrup in beverages may play a role in the epidemic of obesity.","The American journal of clinical nutrition","Bray GA and Nielsen SJ and Popkin BM","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-03-31 15:57:01,-1,2021-04-02 17:30:11,,,,,,,,

Since drugs such as heroin, morphine, alcohol, and cannabinoids, interact with this system, there may be important common neural substrates between food and drug reward with regard to the brain's opioid systems. In this paper, we review the proposed functional role of opioid neurotransmission and mu opiate receptors within the nucleus accumbens and surrounding ventral striatum. Opioid compounds, particularly those selective for the mu receptor, induce a potent increase in food intake, sucrose, salt, saccharin, and ethanol intake. We have explored this phenomenon with regard to macronutrient selection, regional specificity, role of output structures, Fos mapping, analysis of motivational state, and enkephalin gene expression. We hypothesize that opioid-mediated mechanisms within ventral striatal medium spiny neurons mediate the affective or hedonic response to food ('liking' or food 'pleasure'). A further refinement of this hypothesis is that activation of ventral striatal opioids specifically encodes positive affect induced by tasty and/or calorically dense foods (such as sugar and fat), and promotes behaviors associated with this enhanced palatability. It is proposed that this brain mechanism was beneficial in evolutionary development for ensuring the consumption of relatively scarce, high-energy food sources. However, in modern times, with unlimited supplies of high-calorie food, it has contributed to the present epidemic of obesity.","Opioid modulation of taste hedonics within the ventral striatum.","Physiology & behavior","Kelley AE and Bakshi VP and Haber SN and Steininger TL and Will MJ and Zhang M","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-03-31 15:57:16,-1,2021-04-02 17:30:22,,,,,,,,

The orexins (or hypocretins) are neuropeptides recently identified as neurotransmitters in lateral hypothalamus neurons. Although knockout and transgenic overexpression studies have implicated orexin neurons in arousal and sleep, these cells also project to reward-associated brain regions, including the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area. This indicates a possible role for these neurons in reward function and motivation, consistent with previous studies implicating these neurons in feeding. Here we show that activation of lateral hypothalamus orexin neurons is strongly linked to preferences for cues associated with drug and food reward. In addition, we show that chemical activation of lateral hypothalamus orexin neurons reinstates an extinguished drug-seeking behaviour. This reinstatement effect was completely blocked by prior administration of an orexin A antagonist. Moreover, administration of the orexin A peptide directly into the ventral tegmental area also reinstated drug-seeking. These data reveal a new role for lateral hypothalamus orexin neurons in reward-seeking, drug relapse and addiction.","A role for lateral hypothalamic orexin neurons in reward seeking.","Nature","Harris GC and Wimmer M and Aston-Jones G","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-03-31 15:57:59,-1,2021-04-03 20:38:30,,,,,,,,

In addition, in 5 of the alcoholics and 16 of the nonalcoholics, we also measured DA transporters with [11C]d-threo methylphenidate. The ratio of the distribution volumes in striatum to that in cerebellum, which corresponds to Bmax/Kd + 1, was used as model parameter of DA D2 receptor and transporter availability. Dopamine D2 receptor availability (Bmax/Kd) was significantly lower in alcoholics (2.1 +/- 0.5) than in nonalcoholics (2.7 +/- 0.6) (p < 0.05) and was not correlated with days since last alcohol use. Alcoholics showed DA transporter values similar to those in nonalcoholics. The ratio of DA D2 receptor to transporter availability was significantly higher in nonalcoholics (1.4 +/- 0.1) than in alcoholics (1.1 +/- 0.1) (p < 0.005). Alcoholics showed significant reductions in D2 receptors (postsynaptic marker) but not in DA transporter availability (presynaptic marker) when compared with nonalcoholics.

We also tested the idea that anhedonia would be correlated with high-level exercising from the viewpoint that the latter serves as a compensatory behavior for a blunted affect.

OBJECTIVE: Experimental protocols were designed to induce behavioral sensitization through exposures to social-defeat stress or injections of cocaine or morphine. The impact of stress, cocaine or morphine sensitization on cocaine self-administration was assessed using several protocols. METHODS: Behavioral sensitization was induced in male Long-Evans rats by four social-defeat stress episodes, each separated by 72 h. Expression was assessed following a challenge of D-amphetamine (1.0 mg/kg) or cocaine (7.5 mg/kg or 10.0 mg/kg), 10-15 days after the last defeat. Sensitization to cocaine (15.0 mg/kg) or morphine (10.0 mg/kg) was induced via daily administrations for 10 days and later assessed by challenges with cocaine or morphine. Subsequently, i.v. self-administration of cocaine was analyzed for (i) rates of acquisition, (ii) sensitivity to various doses, (iii) 'breaking points' during a progressive ratio schedule of cocaine reinforcement, and (iv) patterns of intake during a 24-h binge, in sensitized and control rats. RESULTS: Social-defeat stress, cocaine or morphine administrations increased the locomotor response to stimulant challenges. During 24-h cocaine self-administration binges, sensitization to social-defeat stress or to cocaine prolonged responding, resulting in more cocaine intake. In addition, cocaine sensitization increased the rate of acquisition to cocaine self-administration and the breaking point during a progressive ratio schedule.

We investigated whether long-term sucrose-drinking causes hyperglycaemia in male Wistar-Imamichi littermates (n 32), which are not genetically susceptible to diabetes or obesity. Each litter was divided equivalently into two groups, the sucrose group and the control group. The sucrose group received 300 g/l sucrose water and the control group received regular water until 42 weeks of age. Rats were weighed every 1 or 2 weeks. Oral glucose tolerance tests were performed at 28 and 36 weeks of age. Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were measured. Body weights were significantly greater in the sucrose group than in the control group in 18-week-old rats (P<0.05), and the difference between the two groups reached 163 g by the end of the study (P<0.01). The 120 min post-load plasma glucose concentration in the sucrose group was 11.4 (SD 2.8) mmol/l in 28-week-old rats and 12.7 (SD 2.2) mmol/l in 36-week-old rats, while that of the control group remained approximately 7.3-7.7 mmol/l. In the sucrose group, the plasma insulin peak occurred 30 min post-load at 28 weeks of age; but the peak disappeared and hyperinsulinaemia was prolonged at 36 weeks of age.

Are reward and pleasure identical? Can taste pleasure be assessed in animals? Is reward necessarily conscious? These questions have re-emerged in recent years, and there is now sufficient evidence to prompt re-examination of many preconceptions concerning reward and its relation to brain systems. This paper reviews evidence from many sources regarding both the psychological structure of food reward and the neural systems that mediate it. Special attention is paid to recent evidence from 'tasty reactivity' studies of affective reactions to food. I argue that this evidence suggests the following surprising possibilities regarding the functional components and brain substrates of food reward. (1) Reward contains distinguishable psychological or functional components--'liking' (pleasure/palatability) and 'wanting' (appetite/incentive motivation). These can be manipulated and measured separately. (2) Liking and wanting have separable neural substrates. Mediation of liking related to food reward involves neurotransmitter systems such as opioid and GABA/benzodiazepine systems, and anatomical structures such as ventral pallidum and brainstem primary gustatory relays. Mediation of wanting related to food reward involves mesotelencephalic dopamine systems, and divisions of nucleus accumbens and amygdala. Both liking and wanting arise from vastly distributed neural systems, but the two systems are separable. (3) Neural processing of food reward is not confined to the limbic forebrain. Aspects of food reward begin to be processed in the brainstem. A neural manipulation can enhance reward or produce aversion but no single lesion or transection is likely abolish all properties of food reward. (4) Both wanting and liking can exist without subjective awareness. Conscious experience can distort or blur the underlying reward process that gave rise to it. Subjective reports may contain false assessments of underlying processes, or even fail at all to register important reward processes. The core processes of liking and wanting that constitute reward are distinct from the subjective report or conscious awareness of those processes.","Food reward: brain substrates of wanting and liking.","Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews","Berridge KC","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 19:51:12,-1,2021-04-03 20:41:14,,,,,,,,

In particular, ghrelin stimulates hunger and promotes food ingestion, whereas leptin increases satiety and reduces food consumption. Therefore, alterations in the physiology of these peptides may play a role in the pathogenesis of eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa. In the present study, we investigated ghrelin and leptin responses to food ingestion in patients with bulimia nervosa. METHOD: Nine symptomatic drug-free bulimic women and 12 age-matched healthy women ingested a meal of 1207 kcal (60% carbohydrates, 23% fat and 17% proteins) at 12.00 a.m. and underwent blood sample collection before and 45, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min after the meal. Plasma levels of ghrelin, leptin, insulin and glucose were measured. RESULTS: In healthy women, circulating ghrelin exhibited a drastic decrease after the food intake whereas, in bulimic patients, this response was significantly blunted. No difference between the two subjects groups was observed in post-prandial profiles of plasma leptin, insulin and glucose. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of a leptin response to food ingestion, in both bulimic and healthy women, is compatible with the role of this peptide as long-term rather than short-term modulator of eating behaviour. The blunted ghrelin response to food ingestion may support the occurrence in bulimic subjects of an impaired suppression of the drive to eat following a meal. This may have implications for binge-eating.","Ghrelin and leptin responses to food ingestion in bulimia nervosa: implications for binge-eating and compensatory behaviours.","Psychological medicine","Monteleone P and Martiadis V and Fabrazzo M and Serritella C and Maj M","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 19:54:09,-1,2021-04-03 20:41:35,,,,,,,,

Previous Fonzies feeding, although it did not affect the increase of extracellular DA in the PFCX in response to Fonzies feeding, blunted that increase in the NAc (habituation); recovery from habituation in the NAc was complete 5 d after previous Fonzies feeding. Predictive association of an otherwise neutral stimulus extrinsic to Fonzies (empty plastic box) with Fonzies feeding resulted in the acquisition by the stimulus of the property to elicit incentive responses directed toward the stimulus and to increase extracellular DA in the PFCX. However, the same stimulus, or a more complex stimulus including intrinsic stimuli (Fonzies-filled plastic box), failed to acquire the ability to modify extracellular DA in the NAc. Pseudoconditioning, i.e., nonpredictive association of the extrinsic stimulus (empty box) with Fonzies feeding, did not result in acquisition by the stimulus of the property to elicit incentive responses and to increase extracellular DA in the PFCX. Repeated nonreinforced presentation of previously conditioned extrinsic stimuli (empty box) resulted in extinction of the property to elicit incentive responses and to increase extracellular DA in the PFCX. These results indicate that in rats fed ad libitum, phasic activation of mesocortical and mesolimbic DA systems by motivational stimuli is differentially influenced by associative (conditioning) and nonassociative (habituation) learning mechanisms and is differentially related to acquisition and expression of incentive motivation.","Differential influence of associative and nonassociative learning mechanisms on the responsiveness of prefrontal and accumbal dopamine transmission to food stimuli in rats fed ad libitum.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Bassareo V and Di Chiara G","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 19:54:38,-1,2021-04-03 20:42:03,,,,,,,,

The opiate withdrawal syndrome is characterized by multiple behavioral and physiological signs such as behavioral activation, ptosis, diarrhea, 'wet dog' shakes and motivational dysfunction, which may be represented in the CNS at multiple sites. It seems that the activating effects associated with the opiate withdrawal syndrome may be mediated by the nucleus locus coeruleus. Other signs such as wet dog shakes may involve sites in the hypothalamus important for temperature regulation. Certain other signs such as diarrhea and lacrimation may be dependent on peripheral opiate receptors. The motivational aspects of opiate withdrawal as demonstrated by the aversive stimulus effects or negative reinforcing effects (e.g. disrupted lever-pressing for food and place aversions) may involve those elements of the nucleus accumbens that are known to be important for the acute reinforcing effects of opiates in nondependent rats. Evidence exists at the cellular and molecular level for both 'within-system' and 'between-system' adaptations to dependence.

To isolate the orosensory effects of taste from possible postingestive consequences, we investigated the quantitative relationship between sham feeding of sucrose and extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens with microdialysis in rats. Sucrose intake linearly increased as a function of concentration (0.03 M, 18.07 +/- 2.41 ml; 0.1 M, 30.92 +/- 2.60 ml; 0.3 M, 43.28 +/- 2.88 ml).

A second experiment used the same protocol but clamped the amount of sucrose ingested and revealed a similar, concentration-dependent dopamine activation in the nucleus accumbens. This is the first demonstration of a quantitative relationship between the concentration-dependent rewarding effect of orosensory stimulation by sucrose during eating and the overflow of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens.

Subjects were also asked to imagine the monotonous diet (which they did not crave). Diet condition had an activating effect on both behavioral (reports of craving) and fMRI measures.

In order to understand some of the neuroreceptor consequences of cocaine administration, groups of rats were injected with cocaine (2 daily doses of 15 mg/kg) for 1 to 21 days. Binding of [3H]cocaine, [3H]SCH23390, [3H]raclopride, and [3H]BTCP in striatal and cortical tissue from the treated animals was compared to controls. [3H]Cocaine binding was increased by the drug in the striatum and cortex at days 14 and 21, respectively. The binding of [3H]SCH23390 to D1 dopamine receptors was significantly increased at day 3 of cocaine exposure. In striatal membranes, [3H]BTCP binding to dopamine uptake sites was significantly increased after day 7, whereas binding in cortical membranes was increased from day 1. [3H]Raclopride binding to D2 dopamine receptors remained unchanged throughout the study in both cortical and striatal tissues. These results indicate that repeated exposure to cocaine produces an upregulation (possible supersensitivity) in cortical D1, cocaine, and DA-uptake sites which occurs in a time-dependent manner. These increases are coupled with an upregulation in striatal D1, cocaine, and DA-uptake sites, without simultaneous changes in D2 receptors. Thus, cocaine's effects are not uniformly distributed across all brain regions, but rather are focused within areas of the dopamine system.","Alterations in the dopaminergic receptor system after chronic administration of cocaine.","Synapse (New York, N.Y.)","Alburges ME and Narang N and Wamsley JK","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 19:55:43,-1,2021-04-03 20:43:54,,,,,,,,

Heroin self-administration behavior (fixed ratio-1; 3-h sessions) was studied from young adulthood (PND 57) into full adults (PND 102). THC-pretreated rats showed an upward shift throughout the heroin self-administration acquisition (30 microg/kg/infusion) phase, whereas control animals maintained the same pattern once stable intake was obtained. Heightened opiate sensitivity in THC animals was also evidenced by higher heroin consumption during the maintenance phase (30 and 60 microg/kg/infusion) and greater responding for moderate-low heroin doses (dose-response curve: 7.5, 15, 30, 60, and 100 microg/kg/injection). Specific disturbance of the endogenous opioid system was also apparent in the brain of adults with adolescent THC exposure. Striatal preproenkephalin mRNA expression was exclusively increased in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell; the relative elevation of preproenkephalin mRNA in the THC rats was maintained even after heroin self-administration. Moreover, mu opioid receptor (muOR) GTP-coupling was potentiated in mesolimbic and nigrostriatal brainstem regions in THC-pretreated animals. muOR function in the NAc shell was specifically correlated to heroin intake.

Radioimmunoassay of the hypothalamus of rats under similar conditions found a pronounced drop in the concentration of beta-endorphin, but not in dynorphin, in the hypothalamus, indicating a release and breakdown of beta-endorphin. Therefore, the reduction in opiate binding in the hypothalamus may at least be partially explained by an occupation of opiate receptors by beta-endorphin, causing a reduced availability of receptors to etorphine.

Rats were prepared with microdialysis probes in the nucleus accumbens and given diazepam (2, 5 and 7.5 mg/kg) acutely and again after chronic treatment. Accumbens dopamine and acetylcholine decreased, with signs of tolerance to the dopamine effect. When these animals were put into the withdrawal state with flumazenil, there was a significant rise in acetylcholine (145%, P<0.001) with a smaller significant rise in dopamine (124%, P<0.01). It is suggested that the increase in acetylcholine release, relative to dopamine, is a neural component of the withdrawal state that is aversive.","Acetylcholine in the accumbens is decreased by diazepam and increased by benzodiazepine withdrawal: a possible mechanism for dependency.","European journal of pharmacology","Rada P and Hoebel BG","Drug-related intermittent or continuous access",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 19:57:03,-1,2021-04-03 20:44:53,,,,,,,,

However, preclinical studies have shown that with repeated drug exposure neutral stimuli paired with the drug (conditioned stimuli) start to increase dopamine by themselves, which is an effect that could underlie drug-seeking behavior. Here we test whether dopamine increases occur to conditioned stimuli in human subjects addicted to cocaine and whether this is associated with drug craving. We tested eighteen cocaine-addicted subjects using positron emission tomography and [11C]raclopride (dopamine D2 receptor radioligand sensitive to competition with endogenous dopamine). We measured changes in dopamine by comparing the specific binding of [11C]raclopride when subjects watched a neutral video (nature scenes) versus when they watched a cocaine-cue video (scenes of subjects smoking cocaine). The specific binding of [11C]raclopride in dorsal (caudate and putamen) but not in ventral striatum (in which nucleus accumbens is located) was significantly reduced in the cocaine-cue condition and the magnitude of this reduction correlated with self-reports of craving. Moreover, subjects with the highest scores on measures of withdrawal symptoms and of addiction severity that have been shown to predict treatment outcomes, had the largest dopamine changes in dorsal striatum. This provides evidence that dopamine in the dorsal striatum (region implicated in habit learning and in action initiation) is involved with craving and is a fundamental component of addiction. Because craving is a key contributor to relapse, strategies aimed at inhibiting dopamine increases from conditioned responses are likely to be therapeutically beneficial in cocaine addiction.","Cocaine cues and dopamine in dorsal striatum: mechanism of craving in cocaine addiction.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Volkow ND and Wang GJ and Telang F and Fowler JS and Logan J and Childress AR and Jayne M and Ma Y and Wong C","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 19:58:05,-1,2021-04-03 20:44:56,,,,,,,,

On day 9, naloxone (5 mg/kg) precipitated withdrawal and increased the release of ACh. When morphine and methylnaloxonium were given locally into the NAc by reverse dialysis, the opiate again decreased extracellular ACh, and the opiate antagonist increased it. These effects were proportional to the dose of local infusions. Local morphine had the same ACh-lowering effect in morphine-dependent and nondependent rats, whereas local methylnaloxonium increased extracellular ACh significantly more in morphine-dependent animals. Systemic and local effects on ACh systems in the PFC were more complicated and showed some relation to locomotor activity. The results suggest that intrinsic ACh neurons in the NAc have a special relationship to opiate reinforcement such that extracellular ACh is low in response to morphine and high during withdrawal.

METHODS: Detailed information about bulimic behaviours were assessed via personal interview in a population-based sample of 1897 Caucasian female twins. We assessed the lifetime prevalence of the component bulimic behaviours and DSM-IV and DSM-III-R BN. Latent class analysis of nine separate bulimic symptoms was used to develop an empirical typology of bulimic behaviour. RESULTS: Although the lifetime prevalences of bingeing (23.6%) and vomiting (4.8%) were relatively common, DSM-IV BN was distinctly uncommon (0.5%). The criterion that specified the frequency and duration of bingeing and vomiting was an important limiting condition. Analysis of alternative thresholds found little support for the DSM-IV thresholds requiring an average of twice per week for 3 months. Latent class analysis yielded an interpretable four class solution that had little overlap with the DSM-IV typology. CONCLUSIONS: As in other studies of unselected samples of women, the lifetime presence of bulimic behaviours are relatively high.

B received a bowl of vegetable shortening for 2 h on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (MWF) and continuous access to powdered chow (regular chow) in all phases. FM had continuous access to a regular chow+shortening mixture (FM chow) that provided the same proportion of shortening and regular chow that the B rats consumed in all phases. In addition, FM had the following: phase 1: no separate bowl of shortening; phase 2: 2-h MWF access to a separate bowl of shortening; phase 3, daily 2-h access to a separate bowl of shortening; C rats had continuous access to the regular chow in all phases.

METHODS: Eight women with bulimia nervosa and 8 female controls underwent brain MRI followed by (11)C-carfentanil PET. Voxel-based methods were used to assess group differences in mu-OR binding between controls and bulimic subjects and to correlate mu-OR binding with the frequency of recent self-reported abnormal eating behaviors in bulimic subjects. RESULTS: mu-OR binding in the left insular cortex was less in bulimic subjects than in controls and correlated negatively with recent fasting behavior. CONCLUSION: Changes in mu-OR binding in the insula may be important in the pathogenesis or maintenance of the self-perpetuating behavioral cycle of bulimic subjects because the insula is the primary gustatory cortex and has repeatedly been implicated in the processing of the reward value of food.","Regional mu-opioid receptor binding in insular cortex is decreased in bulimia nervosa and correlates inversely with fasting behavior.","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine","Bencherif B and Guarda AS and Colantuoni C and Ravert HT and Dannals RF and Frost JJ","study with other mammals other than rat mice",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 19:59:07,-1,2021-04-03 20:47:26,,,,,,,,

Acute administration of morphine dose-dependently decreased acetylcholine (ACh) release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), with 10 mg/kg s.c. being most effective, 5 mg/kg ineffective. On day 5 of spontaneous abstinence from chronic morphine treatment (10-40 mg/kg morphine dose once daily for 5 days), when withdrawal symptoms were still present, even a lower morphine dose (5 mg/kg) was effective in decreasing ACh release in the NAc. During the later phase of abstinence, when no withdrawal symptoms were detectable, the opposite effect, i.e. an increase of ACh release was found. This later effect may represent a long-lasting neuroadaptive effect of morphine. These adaptive effects seemed to be more prominent in the NAc shell.

Recent studies have expanded initial observations that the actions of nicotine on dopaminergic systems increase dopaminergic activity and release, leading to nicotine-induced reinforcement. Indeed, the actions of nicotine on many systems, including brainstem cholinergic, GABAergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic nuclei, may help to mediate nicotine effects related to addiction. Furthermore, studies of mice lacking nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits or expressing supersensitive forms of these subunits have begun to tie together the molecular, neurochemical, and behavioral effects of nicotine. The use of multiple techniques by many laboratories provides optimism that the field is advancing toward elucidating the basic mechanisms of nicotine dependence.","Neuronal systems underlying behaviors related to nicotine addiction: neural circuits and molecular genetics.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Picciotto MR and Corrigall WA","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:00:53,-1,2021-04-03 21:03:33,,,,,,,,

The etiology of binge eating remains perplexing in part because, in humans, it is difficult to isolate and assess the independent and aggregate impact of various contributing variables. Using rats, we found that footshock stress and a history of caloric restriction (S+R), combine synergistically to induce binge eating. Stress and dieting are also strong antecedents and relapse factors in human eating disorders. Here we report further behavioral and physiological parallels to human binge eating. Like the protracted course of human binge eating, young female Sprague-Dawley rats continued to binge eat after 23 restriction/stress cycles (7 months) and this despite experiencing no significant weight loss during the restriction phases. Stress alone reduced adiposity by 35% (p<0.001) but S+R rats had no significant fat loss. An endocrine profile of normal plasma leptin and insulin levels but marked elevation of plasma corticosterone levels was found only in the binge-eating (S+R) rats (p<0.01), also paralleling endocrine profiles reported in clinical binge-eating studies. These behavioral and physiological similarities between this animal model and clinical binge eating increase its utility in understanding binge eating. Importantly, our findings also highlight the stubborn nature of binge eating: once a critical experience with dieting and stress is experienced, little if any further weight loss or food restriction is necessary to sustain it.","Body composition and endocrine status of long-term stress-induced binge-eating rats.","Physiology & behavior","Artiga AI and Viana JB and Maldonado CR and Chandler-Laney PC and Oswald KD and Boggiano MM","drug, optogenetic or comoribities at the time of intermittent protocol",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:01:03,-1,2021-04-03 21:03:55,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, the present study employed the technique of in vivo microdialysis to examine the effects of selective mu-, delta-, and kappa- opioids on DA release in the nucleus accumbens (NAC) of anesthetized rats. Microdialysis probes were inserted into the NAC and perfusates were analyzed for DA and its metabolites, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DO-PAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), using a reverse-phase HPLC system with electrochemical detection for separation and quantification. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of selective mu-opioid [D-Ala2, N-methyl-Phe4, Gly5-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) or delta-opioid [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]-enkephalin (DPDPE) agonists, at doses that function as positive reinforcers in rats, resulted in an immediate and significant increase in extracellular DA. DOPAC and HVA levels were also significantly increased. The effects of DAMGO were blocked by the selective mu-antagonist D-Pen-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2 (CTOP) whereas those of DPDPE were blocked by the delta-antagonist allyl2-Tyr-Aib-Aib-Phe-Leu-OH (ICI 174,864). In contrast to mu- and delta-agonists, the kappa-agonist N-CH3-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu-Arg-N-CH3-Arg-D-Leu-NHC2H5 (E-2078), a dynorphin analog that produces aversive states, decreased DA release in a biphasic manner. Norbinaltorphimine, a selective kappa-antagonist, could block this effect. These results demonstrate that mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid agonists differentially affect DA release in the NAC and this action is centrally mediated.","The effects of opioid peptides on dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens: an in vivo microdialysis study.","Journal of neurochemistry","Spanagel R and Herz A and Shippenberg TS","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:01:20,-1,2021-04-03 21:04:27,,,,,,,,

The present experiment investigated whether prior exposure to a sensitizing regimen of amphetamine treatment would 'globally' enhance future appetitive behaviors of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, and whether the drug preexposure-environment or intermittency of administration would affect this development. Reward appetite was compared in drug-experienced versus drug-naive rats using amphetamine place-preference conditioning (CPP) and a natural-incentive sensitization task, which measured appetitive approach for food and sexual reward. Experiment I found that 10 daily exposures to 1 mg/kg amphetamine did not alter future psychostimulant CPP, regardless of abstinence schedule. Although daily exposure to a higher amphetamine dose also did not alter appetitive behavior when measured after 2-weeks drug abstinence in Experiment II, alternate-day amphetamine experience (5.0 mg/kg, twice-a-day) in an initially unfamiliar environment persistently enhanced future amphetamine CPP and appetitive behavior for natural reward. Identical treatment administered in the homecage did not. Furthermore, sensitized reward-seeking behaviors were not globally evident. Animals that showed sensitized amphetamine CPP did not show sensitized food-seeking behavior and vice versa. Thus, the environment surrounding chronic psychostimulant drug experience can greatly affect subsequent reward appetite, but the sensitized expression may be individually determined.","Chronic intermittent amphetamine pretreatment enhances future appetitive behavior for drug- and natural-reward: interaction with environmental variables.","Behavioural brain research","Nocjar C and Panksepp J","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:01:35,-1,2021-04-03 21:04:55,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Evidence from experimental research points to the relative importance of episode frequency, the amount of food consumed at episodes, the subjective sense of loss of control over eating, and several additional criteria associated with binge episodes in BED. Evidence on the differences in psychopathology between BED and bulimia nervosa and between BED and obesity without binge eating, as related to diagnostic criteria, is reviewed.

The present study examined whether female rats on various regimens of sugar access would show behavioral cross-sensitization to a low dose of amphetamine. After a 30-min baseline measure of locomotor activity (day 0), animals were maintained on a cyclic diet of 12-h deprivation followed by 12-h access to 10% sucrose solution and chow pellets (12 h access starting 4 h after onset of the dark period) for 21 days. Locomotor activity was measured again for 30 min at the beginning of days 1 and 21 of sugar access. Beginning on day 22, all rats were maintained on ad libitum chow. Nine days later locomotor activity was measured in response to a single low dose of amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg). The animals that had experienced cyclic sucrose and chow were hyperactive in response to amphetamine compared with four control groups (ad libitum 10% sucrose and chow followed by amphetamine injection, cyclic chow followed by amphetamine injection, ad libitum chow with amphetamine, or cyclic 10% sucrose and chow with a saline injection). These results suggest that a diet comprised of alternating deprivation and access to a sugar solution and chow produces bingeing on sugar that leads to a long lasting state of increased sensitivity to amphetamine, possibly due to a lasting alteration in the dopamine system.","A diet promoting sugar dependency causes behavioral cross-sensitization to a low dose of amphetamine.","Neuroscience","Avena NM and Hoebel BG","No measure of food related behavior (lever presses, progressive ratio breaking point, food receptacle approaches, etc)",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:02:16,-1,2021-04-03 21:08:00,,,,,,,,

Morphine dependence was induced by subcutaneous implantation of two morphine pellets for 6 days. Rats were made abstinent by removal of the pellets 1, 2 or 3 days before they were killed. The mRNA levels coding for D1- and D2-dopamine receptors, dynorphin, preproenkephalin A and substance P were determined by quantitative in situ hybridization. The caudate putamen and the nucleus accumbens showed equivalent modifications in dopamine receptor and neuropeptide gene expression. After 6 days of morphine, a decrease in D2-dopamine receptor and neuropeptide mRNA levels was observed (-30%), but there was no change in D1-dopamine receptor mRNA. In abstinent rats, both D1- and D2-dopamine receptor mRNA levels were decreased 1 day after withdrawal (-30% compared with chronic morphine). In contrast, neuropeptide mRNA levels were unaffected when compared with those observed after 6 days of morphine. During the second and third day of withdrawal, there was a gradual return to the levels seen in the placebo-treated group, for both dopamine receptor and neuropeptide mRNAs. Phenotypical characterization of striatal neurons expressing mu and kappa opioid receptor mRNAs showed that, in striatonigral neurons, both mRNAs were colocalized with D1-receptor and Dyn mRNAs. Our results suggest that during morphine dependence, dopamine and morphine exert opposite effects on striatonigral neurons, and that effects occurring on striatopallidal neurons are under dopaminergic control. We also show that withdrawal is associated with a down regulation of the postsynaptic D1 and D2 receptors.","Chronic morphine exposure and spontaneous withdrawal are associated with modifications of dopamine receptor and neuropeptide gene expression in the rat striatum.","The European journal of neuroscience","Georges F and Stinus L and Bloch B and Le Moine C","no comparison between intermittent or continuous  food access groups",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:02:27,-1,2021-04-03 21:08:26,,,,,,,,

Ch5 cells and Ch6 cells are inhibited by local injections of muscarinic agonists, suggesting the presence of autoreceptors. This review advances the hypothesis that the psychotogenic effects of antimuscarinics are triggered by disinhibition of Ch5 and Ch6 cells via their autoreceptors, and that these effects are distinct from the memory-blocking effects of antimuscarinics mediated through the Ch1-Ch4 projections to the forebrain. Neuroleptic and antiparkinson agents with antimuscarinic effects selectively block m1 muscarinic receptors, whereas psychotogenic antimuscarinics are nonselective. In rats, scopolamine injected near Ch5 cells facilitates rewarding brain stimulation and induces locomotion and stereotypy, apparently via activation of dopaminergic systems. Systemically administered scopolamine induces locomotion and stereotypy via muscarinic receptors near Ch5 cells. Ch5 activation and Ch6 activation may be a causal factor in some forms of schizophrenia. Some schizophrenics show early-onset REM sleep, a condition that can result from Ch5 and Ch6 cholinergic activation of the pontine reticular formation. Schizophrenics with early-onset REM, or visual hallucinations, show more severe positive symptoms and negative symptoms. Ch5 cells and Ch6 cells have been found in twice-normal numbers in a few brains of schizophrenics. Several genetic and onset factors for schizophrenia that may be linked to Ch5 cells are considered, as well as treatment strategies based on inhibition of Ch5 cells and Ch6 cells, or blockade of their terminals.","Role of tegmental cholinergic neurons in dopaminergic activation, antimuscarinic psychosis and schizophrenia.","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Yeomans JS","non-experimental study",-1,,-1,2021-04-01 20:02:45,-1,2021-04-03 21:08:56,,,,,,,,

Highly palatable foods activate these same brain areas, specifically the nucleus accumbens. In this study, the effects of a highly palatable food (sucrose) on these circuits were investigated using the dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptor agonist quinpirole. Male Long-Evans rats received 30 min daily access to 0.3 M sucrose solution or water over nine consecutive days, followed by nine daily injections of quinpirole (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) or saline. Locomotor activity was assessed using an automated open-field system. Locomotor sensitization developed, as quinpirole-treated rats traveled significantly more, and exhibited a greater number of movements than saline controls. A characteristic pattern of an initial suppression of locomotor activity, followed by excitation of activity was observed in quinpirole-treated rats. Pre-exposure to sucrose attenuated the initial suppression of activity, and facilitated excitation of activity. Rats that were pre-exposed to sucrose exhibited a reduced suppression of activity as compared to rats pre-exposed to water. Rats receiving sucrose and quinpirole also displayed a significantly greater enhancement of locomotor activity as compared to rats receiving water and quinpirole. These results support the hypothesis that highly palatable foods can alter the same neural reward circuits as drugs of abuse, and may facilitate sensitization-related addiction.
