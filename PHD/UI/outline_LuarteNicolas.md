# Obesity health risks
- Fast growth in modern society
- Environmental variables are critical in obesity

# Homeostatic and hedonic feeding behavior
- Definition

- Behavioral controllers of feeding behavior
	- Value assignment to choice

# Behavioral controllers under the cafeteria diet

- Definition of cafeteria diet
- Cafeteria diet induced obesity
- Decision-making dysregulations in obesity
	- Temporal discounting


# Feeding neurobiology in obesity

- Orexin and dynorphin regulating hedonic intake
	- State-dependent effect (obese / non-obese)
	- Site-specific effect


- Orexin/Dynorphin modulation of food preferences
	- Modulation of the reward properties of food
	- Effects on reward systems (reward prediction error)
