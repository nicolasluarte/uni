# Initial thoughts

- we have mice that are offered two option of food at a given cost (FR 5) sucrose and umami
- mice develop a preference and have certain elasticity parameter (alpha) for each of the options
- later on, the preferred option is punished
- we can observe changes in elasticity given punishment
- consumption of not preferred option
- we track movement, can relate deviation from optimal path for each of succesful consumptions
- then we can (a) measure levels of orexin/dyn, we can repeat the test given injections of both in PVN
