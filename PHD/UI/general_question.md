# Initial thoughts

- we have mice that are offered two option of food at a given cost (FR 5) sucrose and umami
- mice develop a preference and have certain elasticity parameter (alpha) for each of the options
- later on, the preferred option is punished
- we can observe changes in elasticity given punishment
- consumption of not preferred option
- we track movement, can relate deviation from optimal path for each of succesful consumptions
- then we can (a) measure levels of orexin/dyn, we can repeat the test given injections of both in PVN

# Title

- 'Role of orexin and opioid dynorphin peptides in food intake and obesity'
- 'Real-time centroid calculation for behavioral experiments'

# Laboratory and tutor

- Claudio Perez Leighton

# General question

- What's the difference in the effect of dynorphin and orexin in hedonic intake, between preferred and non-preferred food?
- This can be in a 'elasticity' measurement scenario
- or Free behavior scenario

# Theory (brief)

- orexin role
- dyn role
- site specific
- hedonic
- homeostatic

# Hypothesis

- aim 3

# General objectives

- explicar el desarrollo de la maquinita

# Methods

- como medir el spa
- coordinaci√≥n con el licometro
- mostrar estudio
