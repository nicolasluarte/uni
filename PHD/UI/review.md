# Orexin, feeding and foraging

# Food-seeking behavior and uncertainty

Uncertainty can be understood as a measure of the expectation of the reward prediction error in given environment. This measure of difference between expected reward and current reward is encoded by dopamine neurons [@ZHGB75KH#Bayer_Glimcher_2005]. Furthermore, this system can modify decision-making policies based on the reward-prediction error [@87WR6HV3#Pessiglione_Etal_2006]. Food-seeking behavior, can be conceptualized as series of decision-making actions occurring in an environment with varying grades of uncertainty, where each feeding bout is evaluated by the reward prediction error, and over a history of bouts, uncertainty over environment rewards is obtained.

Under higher uncertainty levels of environment food disposition, animal food-seeking bouts are increased resulting in hoarding-type behavior, arguably as a mechanism to prevent possible starvation [@C6Z374UG#Anselme_Güntürkün_2019]. However, this behavior can also be explained by food scarcity or insufficient energetic supply by the environment. The latter case doesn't necessarily predict uncertainty as this can be high in average, but volatile from time to time. Nevertheless, when feeding environment is altered by constant changes in food position, an increased intake is observed [@NL4XYLRH#Forkman_1993], so food access variability can trigger, by itself, an increased food-seeking behavior. Sign-tracking also increases when uncertainty about reward probabilities also increases [@S8CHV5KG#Anselme_Robinson_Berridge_2013], that is, motivation is increased under uncertainty of reward delivery. In addition to modifying intake, uncertainty levels, can affect energy expenditure [@LLLWQCZE#Bednekoff_Houston_1994], even when overall food levels are equated in predictable and unpredictable setting [@3GQMEPEH#Cuthill_2000].

If uncertainty can modulate food-seeking behavior in order to increase intake, and better sustain energetic reserves. It is expected to have, at least, to functional instances (1) a uncertainty sensing unit and (2) a reward processing unit, which can relay information to homeostatic-related and decision-making loci, to integrate such information a determine the next action to take. In humans such functional instances seems to be separated, where nucleus accumbens, thalamus and medial orbitofrontal cortex are more activated in unpredictable reward scenarios, and predictable scenarios with right superior temporal gyrus [@G5PZHPCI#Tanaka_Etal_2006]. Task-related brain activity is reduced in more predictable environments, likely by lowering mean prediction error, however, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), shows augmented activation when predictability drops [@9SRBHI4W#Davis_Choi_Benoit_2010]. When situated in a learning task, ventral striatum has been related to short-term reward prediction, whereas dorsal striatum was related with long-term reward prediction [@G5PZHPCI#Tanaka_Etal_2006]. Short-term reward prediction is closely related with uncertain environment as immediate rewards don't provide any information about subsequent rewards, which is the opposite case of certain (or regular) environments, where each rewards provide all information to predict the next reward.

add a little more of structure, and then examine models of this

then add 1 paragraph about orexin in reward prediction and uncertainty

then put orexin and foraging
