# Obesity as a chronic disease
- Demographics
- Behavioral traits of obesity

# Neurobiology of feeding behavior
- Homeostatic and hedonic intake
	- 'Control circuits'
- Neuro-regulation of feeding behavior (orexin and dynorhin)
	- Obesity-prone and obesity-resistant models
	- OP/OR high-fat diet and SPA (spontaneous physical activity) / NEAT (nonexercise thermogenesis)
	- OP/OR orexin-receptors levels

# Behavioral dysregulations caused by obesity
- Decision-making framework
- Homeostatic balance dysruption
- Cognitive impairments of high-fat diets
- Altered sensitivity to food cues

# Cafeteria diet and obesity
- Genetically obese versus obesity induction
- Cafeteria diet induces obesity explained by decision-making framework
- Obesity effects on orexin and dynorphin effects
- Expected results and hypothesis

"" Here I want to explain how, through the decision-making framework, we can explain, why ox and dyn effects are reduced
