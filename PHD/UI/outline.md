title: Role of orexin and opioid dynorphin peptides in obesity behavioral dysregulation
---

"" why the study of obesity is relevant today

# Obesity health risks
- Fast growth in modern society
"" fast rate of growth points that purely biological causes are unlikely
- Environmental variables are critical in obesity

"" Environmental variables become relevant when they interact with behavior through 'decision making'

# Homeostatic and hedonic feeding behavior
- Definition

"" This should provide a model that explains feeding behavior as a series of decisions ("feeding bouts") and how value is assigned to each dietary option

- Behavioral controllers of feeding behavior
	- 'Reinforcement learning' action/state/value/reward model

"" How are these behavioral controllers affected by the environmental variables

# Behavioral controllers under the cafeteria diet

"" If obesity happens in a particular environment, how the behavioral controllers are dysregulated in order to consume more calories than those used

- Definition of cafeteria diet
- Cafeteria diet induced obesity
- Decision-making dysregulations

"" What obesity does at the level of behavior should be clear up to this point, now it should state how obesity does this.

# Feeding neurobiology in obesity

"" This section should be the longest

"" State-dependent effects should be reviewed both ways (1) ox/dyn (injection) effect in obese animals; (2) ox/dyn levels in obese animals

"" Site-specific is related to PVN versus Ventral tegmental area

- Orexin and dynorphin regulating hedonic intake
	- State-dependent effect (obese / non-obese)
	- Site-specific effect
- How these peptides could regulate controllers value functions
	- Modulation of the reward properties of food
"" leptin, ghrelin, insulin (?)

"" By this point it should be clear how orexin/dynorphin modulate neural activity and how that neural activity is related to the 'behavioral controllers'

# Conclusions
