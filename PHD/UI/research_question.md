What determines the preference of one food over another?

Expected reward value of food option will likely determine the preference in the decision-making process. However, expectation is built around an estimate value of a particular action (to obtain food) and the environment response. The latter defines reward uncertainty by defining the probabilistic pairing of action-reward. While the effects of food properties (such as fat content), and nutritional state on food intake have been largely studied, the effect of environmental variables which are not directly related to food content are laking in the literature.

Combinations:

1. Neural-state (ox/dyn) and environmental uncertainty
2. Development of preference and environmental uncertainty
3. Preference-neural-state and environmental uncertainty

Environmental uncertainty: defined by Shannon entropy, is a function applied to the probability of obtaining a given reward.

Options:

1. same action, different reward
2. same reward, different action

## pointers

- In a T-maze decision-making task, two goal arms, different rewards and costs
- oxr1 antagonists in ACC and/or OFC -> preference for low reward with no cost
- ox1 receptor in the mPFC evaluate and pay the cost to acquire greater rewards
- Wistar rats
- barrier height was the cost
- transient time: time from a start point to decision point before chose an arm
- decision time: time from a decision
- with receptor blocked they swaped preference to small rewards without any cost
- no effect on transient time
- differential delay has the same effect as barriers
- locomotor activity did not change with OX1 receptor antagonist
- author suggest 3 options: (1) change in value encoding; (2) difference in cost encoding; (3) change in processing cost-benefit computations
- they suggest is option (3), because 1 and 2 are refuted in equal cost equal reward experiments
- orexin blockade increased decision-making time in the OFC

## figures

1. schematic illustration of the apparatus. two arms: (a) high reward; (b) low reward. It could be effort based or time based cost
2. injections were in ACC and OFC
3. injection on ACC effect (orexin 1 receptor antagonist) decreased percent of high reward choice, the effect is visible only when there's differential effort, meaning that injection prevented rats to pay a cost for a greater reward
4. transient time: time from a start point to a decision point before choosing the arm; decision time: decision was defined as time from a decision; there was no difference in ACC
5. injection on OFC, effect on high reward choice on differential delay; but not for equal delay
6. No effects on transient time
7. OX1r could accelerate the process which leads to decision, role in calculation of the cost benefit in the delay-based decision-making but not in effort-based decision-making
8. No effect on locomotor activity

## pointers

- VTA DA inhibita D2 in NAc
- NC (narcoleptic with cataplexy) (orexin deficient) pacient score lower in the iowa gambling task compared to controls
- scores in the IGT started to differ significantly in the later block (possibly failing to reverse?)

## pointers

- orexin cell activity is reduced during the sensorimotor act of eating; hypothesis: eating may be driven, in part, by a desire to reduce the "stressful" orexin signals in the brain
- natural orexin signalling normally suipresses risk-taking
- orexin -> d2 risk-avoidance; orexin -> gad65 (in LH) locomotion
- VTA DA inhibita D2 in NAc
