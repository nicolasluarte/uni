title: Junk food exposure disrupts selection of food-seeking actions in rats
---


# Introduction

- Alternative title: action selection after junk food
- Food-seeking actions are expected to be a function of expected food values
- Junk-food disrupts this

# Hypothesis

1. Junk-food consumption makes food evaluation different, \
less sensitive to specific devaluation
2. Junk-food consuption impairs action-outcome and stimulus-outcome mappings, \
retrieval and formation

- Hypothesis 2 implies that junk-food impairs control on food-seeking behavior \
even when food values are not the primary basis for decision-making

- Hypothesis 2 is the one held by the authors, hypothesis 1 has already been \
'confirmed' [@5REMJA6P#Furlong_Etal_2014]

# Methods

- Sprague-dawley rats (n = 24)
- 85%~ by weight food restriction

# Methods: pavlovian conditioning

- Training before diet exposure
- 8 daily sessions
- white noise & clicker; chocolate pellets || sweet condensed milk (SCM)
- outcome -> random time 30 sec

# Methods: instrumental learning

- Training before diet exposure
- 11 days of training, 2 session per day
- 1 reward delivered (counterbalanced); chocolate pellets || SCM

# Methods: instrumental learning

# Junk-food diet

|-------------------|:----------------------:|:----------------------------:|-------------------------------|
| Basal Diet        |   Chow + Water ad lib  |      Chow + Water ad lib     | Chow + Water ad lib           |
| Experimental Diet |            -           | +1 Hr junk-food access (CAF) | +24 Hr junk-food access (CAF) |

# Outcome devaluation testing

- 1 food devaluated at a time
- To devaluate: exposed to 1 hr of food ad lib (same two levers)
- 5 min choioce extintion test (no cues nor reward)
- Data: lever presses + food cup entries
- 48 later same test with the other food

# Outcome devaluation test: why?

- The reinforcement learning theory posits that animals \
maximize rewards upon expected values
- Expected value is dependent on many variables, satiation is one of the most relevant
- Previous exposure to a specific food acts like a food-specific satiation
- Choices must reflect theoretical expect-value: \
pick the highest reward option more times
- If values changes, so must the election
- Extinction test picked, because it allows to separate effects from learning

# Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer testing

![Pavlovian to instrumental transition](/home/nicoluarte/uni/PHD/journal_club/presentation4/fig1.png){ width=50% }

# Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer testing

- 48 hours after devaluation
- Data: lever-presses + food cup entries
- Non-contingent cue presentation (clicker || white noise)
- No outcome delivered
- 8 trials total with pseudorandom order
- cue presented for 2 minutes

# Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer testing: why?

- General (non-specific PIT): cue -> go eat food (regardless of cue type)
- Specific PIT: previously learned cue-food -> previously learned lever-food
- Authors want to measure impairements in cue-outcome / action-outcome mappings
- Possible because training was done previous to testing (learning not affected)

# Experimental schedule

![Experimental phases](/home/nicoluarte/uni/PHD/journal_club/presentation4/fig2.png){ width=60% }

# Results: behavioral training

## Pavlovian

- Main measure: Cue responding vs pre-cue responding (food cup entries)
- There was no effect of diet in the main measure (p = 0.82); t-test =/= 0
- However, conditioned cup-entries during cue presentation (p < 0.001); \
food-cup entries matched cue

# Results: behavioral training

## Instrumental training

- Average of last 3 days of instrumental learning (mean response rate)
- Rats pressed more for chocolate pellet (mean 42.89 vs 22.10)
- Diet did not influence lever press rate (p = 0.37)
- Diet did not influence food preference (p = 0.42)

# Discussion

- Decision-makings impairement is not due increase in food-seeking behavior
- This impairement is not caused by problems in the learning phase, \
a more plausible hypothesis is that value updating is impaired
- Moreover, even without the need to update values (PIT test), decision-making \
is impaired
- Retrieving or using cue-outcome / action-outcome is impaired

# Discussion

- The problem might be an over-generalization of cues (a cue means food and just that)
- Sensitization of mesolimbic dopamine transmission [@XMCXMS73#Avena_Hoebel_2003]
- Non-specific PIT was not affected. only specific PIT
- This difference might point that junk-food impair the use of environmental \
cues to guide food-seeking behavior

# Discussion

- Intermittent group did not have an increase of food-seeking behavior?
- Authors posit that perhaps in the ad lib group junk-food created binge-eating micro-events
- I think, perhaps, the intermittent diet was too constant, so no perceived insecurity on food \
access was generated

# Discussion: main point

- Junk-food exposure does not augmen food-seeking behavior magnitude \
it makes food-seeking behavior independent of top-down control, thus making it \
more 'mindless'
