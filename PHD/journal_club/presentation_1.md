# This study 'confronts' to lines of evidence

- Determine the nuances of opioid control of feeding
	- "one peptide, one nutrient"
	- opioids modulate intake of a preferred diet, but not of a non-preferred diet

# However previous data had potential confounds

- methods to stimulate intake were either: (a) deprivation, (b) restriction of intake or (c) drug-stimulation

# To account for that, they used a 'binge eating model'

- animals will eat significant amounts of food, even when satiated, if the presentation of snacks are unpredictable and at the end of the light cycle (limiting access to fatty-food or high-sucrose) [@U6AEHJN5#Naleid_Etal_2007]
- this allows to model 'spontaneous feeding' (more similar to human-type feeding)

# Having a feeding model, they attempted to clarify opioid control of feeding

- They used PVN (paraventricular nucleus) as a site for testing the effects of opioids in the choice of two palatable diets (fat or sucrose)
- Also, they tested this model against the previous ones (deprivation-induced feeding)

# Opioids and opioid antagonist used

- Naltrexone (NTX): opioid antagonist
	- 0, 10, 30 and 100 nmol)
	- intra-PVN / subcutaneously
- DAMGO: sythetic opioid, high affinity to mu-receptor
	- intra-PVN
	- 0, 0.025, 0.25 and 2.5 nmol)

# The experimental setup (diet-choice experiment)

- continual access to standard rodent chow and water
- after surgery recovery they were presented with a jar of fat diet and pellets of AIN 76 (sucrose)
- presentation was in their home cages for 3h a day, water was available but chow was blocked
- counterbalanced, repeated measures

# After 3 weeks animals presented clear preferences

- $\frac{fat \; intake}{sucrose \; intake}$
- If the ratio was >1 = fat consumer
- If the ratio was <1 = sucrose consumer

# Total intake increased with DAMGO injection

# Intake difference increased only for fat preference group

# NTX reduced total intake only for fat preference group

# NTX reduced intake difference for both groups

# The experimental setup (no-choice experiment)

- group 1: only sucrose diet
	- Exposed to sucrose
- group 2: food restricted to 80% of free-feeding intake
	- chow intake

# The experimental setup (no-choice experiment)

- Injected with NTX intro the PVN
- Injected with NTX subcutaneously

# Results (no-choice experiment) group 1

# Contrary to author's hypothesis DAMGO and NTX effects were modulated by diet preference

- DAMGO stimulated fat intake primarily in fat preference group
	- opioid system is different in fat-preferring animals
	- opioids do not alter sucrose intake

# The differential effects of DAMGO and NTX in fat and sucrose diet groups reveal differences in the opioid system

- NTX decreased the amount of fat-to-sucrose in both groups
	- NTX is a non-selective opioid antagonist
- however, DAMGO didn't increase fat-to-sucrose intake in sucrose group
	- DAMGO has high mu-receptor affinity
- if receptor ratios (mu-receptor to other types of receptors) were equal in both groups, no difference should be expected
	- fat group mu-receptors > sucrose group mu-receptors
	- NTX blockade of non-mu-receptors is responsible for reduce fat intake in sucrose group

# The differential effects of DAMGO and NTX in fat and sucrose diet groups reveal differences in the opioid system

- intra-PVN versus subcutaneous NTX injection tell us that sucrose intake regulation control-locus is somewhere outside the PVN (p = 0.056)
- so up until now, results indicate that PVN regulated fat intake and sucrose intake is regulated somwhere else
	- however if we include the chow-restriction experiment, we can add that PVN controls intake based on caloric need
	- so we could have a multi-function control locus or, as author's put it, results can be interpreted as PVN being a energy-control system because fat is the most calorie-dense nutrient

# General discussion

- opioids may have differences in function depending on site of action
- opioid receptor activation effect is dependent on dietary preference
- PVN controls intake in time of caloric need (but fat-intake doesn't clearly fit in)
