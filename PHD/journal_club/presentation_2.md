## Background

### 'Hypothalamus plays an essential role in the regulation of feeding behavior'
	- Ventromedial hypothalamus -> 'satiety center'
	- Lateral hypothalamus -> 'feeding center'

### Author's focus on the arcuate nucleus
	- Agouticortin related protein (AgRP) -> orexigenic
	- POMC -> anorexigenic

### Proposed mechanism

## Models

### To test the previous mechanism experimental manipulation of both neuronal system is required

	- POMC and NPY neurons share a common cellular origin
		- If origin is shared, then traditional transgenic manipulation allow to activate both systems at the same time
		- Virally mediated instead allows for selective POMC neurons activation


### Model 1: viral POMC-ChR2
![](/home/nicoluarte/Downloads/cre2.png){ width=80% }

- Adeno-associated virus carries blue-light activation + fluorescent protein
- Not expressed because of inversion
- POMC-CRE inverts -> expression only in POMC


### Model 2: embryonic POMC-expressing progrenitor control (sub-set AgRP/NPY + POMC)
![](/home/nicoluarte/Downloads/cre.png){ width=80% }

- Ended up in AgRP/NPY blue light activated, green fluorescent protein model
- neuron depolarization -> cFos

### With the models at hand, they tested intake dependent on differential activation

- 'Rapid inhibition of feeding behavior in fasted viral POMC-ChR2 mice'
- 'Rapid and robust increase in food intake in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice'


## Results

### Experimental setup

- ad libitum access to standard laboratory pellet before and after tests
- testes at same time of the day
- when food deprived: 4 hours + ad libitum water

### 'Rapid inhibition of feeding behavior in fasted viral POMC-ChR2 mice'
![](/home/nicoluarte/Downloads/exp1.png){ width=90% }

- If activation of POMC-neurons is successful, then beta-endorphin + alpha-MSH should be active
- They previously showed that global POMC-neuron activation was successful via cFos marker
- We should expect (1) reduced apetite + (2) analgesic effect
- If we block opioid receptor agonist with naloxone, analgesic effect of beta-endorphin should go down
