## Background

### 'Hypothalamus plays an essential role in the regulation of feeding behavior'
- Ventromedial hypothalamus -> 'satiety center'
- Lateral hypothalamus -> 'feeding center'

### Author's focus on the arcuate nucleus
- Agouticortin related protein (AgRP) -> orexigenic
- POMC -> anorexigenic

### Proposed mechanism

## Models

### To test the previous mechanism experimental manipulation of both neuronal system is required

- POMC and NPY neurons share a common cellular origin
	- If origin is shared, then traditional transgenic manipulation allow to activate both systems at the same time
	- Virally mediated instead allows for selective POMC neurons activation


### Model 1: viral POMC-ChR2
![](/home/nicoluarte/Downloads/cre2.png){ width=80% }

- Adeno-associated virus carries blue-light activation + fluorescent protein
- Not expressed because of inversion
- POMC-CRE inverts -> expression only in POMC


### Model 2: embryonic POMC-expressing progrenitor control (sub-set AgRP/NPY + POMC)
![](/home/nicoluarte/Downloads/cre.png){ width=80% }

- Ended up in AgRP/NPY blue light activated, green fluorescent protein model
- neuron depolarization -> cFos

### With the models at hand, they tested intake dependent on differential activation

- 'Rapid inhibition of feeding behavior in fasted viral POMC-ChR2 mice'
- 'Rapid and robust increase in food intake in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice'


## Results

### Experimental setup

- ad libitum access to standard laboratory pellet before and after tests
- testes at same time of the day
- when food deprived: 4 hours + ad libitum water

### 'Rapid inhibition of feeding behavior in fasted viral POMC-ChR2 mice'
![](/home/nicoluarte/Downloads/exp1.png){ width=90% }

- If activation of POMC-neurons is successful, then beta-endorphin + alpha-MSH should be active
- They previously showed that global POMC-neuron activation was successful via cFos marker
- We should expect (1) reduced apetite + (2) analgesic effect
- If we block opioid receptor agonist with naloxone, analgesic effect of beta-endorphin should go down

### 'Rapid and robust increase in food intake in Tg POMC-ChR2 mice'
![](/home/nicoluarte/Downloads/exptg.png){ width=90% }

- If activating both sets of neurons, at the same time, increases intakes, then the conclusion is that the effect of POMC-neurons is greater than AgRP

## Neuroanatomy

### There seems to be a differentiated network between embryionic POMC-derived neurons and adult POMC

- Arc POMC-derived 
	- Majority of projections in hypothalamic areas
	- Lateral hypothalamic nucleus

- Adult Arc POMC-neurons
	- Median eminence
	- Nucleus accumbens
	- Thalamic paraventricular nucleus
	- ...

- The main point here is to show that they differ in projection patterns

### Following cFos as an inderect measure of activity they found significant differences in activation patterns (following light stimulation)

- Transgenic mice had broader activation areas
	- PFC
	- Caudate-putamen
	- Nucleus accumbens
	- PVN
	- Lateral thalamus
	- ...
- Viral mice had a more restricted activation
	- Cerebral cortex
	- Lateral septum
	- Dorsomedial hypothalamus

## Discussion

### One last result

- A result to tie in things
	- If effects seen are because of opioids, then blocking them should prevent cFos expression
		- Upon naloxone this indeed happened
		- Behavioral results followed

### Feeding reduction in a dose dependent
![](/home/nicoluarte/Downloads/last.png){ width=90% }

- Light stimulation beta: 1.08
- Naloxone at 2mg/kg beta: -0.33
- similar intake between mice

### Using sated versus unsated models

- Light stimulation in sated doesn't generate acute intake increase (Essner et al., 2017) in POMC-neurons
	- Different baseline for unsated mice
	- Different light protocol

### Opioid receptor-signaling system is likely to be present

- Other opioids are in play beta-endorphin was correlated with a decrease in intake (in viral mice)
- But opioid antagonist blocked intake increase
	- Loss of function evidence

### Increased intake in transgenic mice could be due to rewarding characteristics of food
- Tg Mice had a broad activation pattern, that included the PFC (and with that dopamine activation)
- Lateral hypothalamus is related to motivated feeding behavior

### General Conclusions

- POMC-neurons and AgRP-neuron have opposing effects on feeding, however:
	- This effect is dependent on neuronal projection pathways
	- Probably nutritionally state-dependent
	- Opiod systems is likely to be involved in this regulation (beyond analgesic effects of beta-endorphin)
