# Mu opioid receptos antagonism in the nucleus accumbens shell blocks consumption of a preferred sucrose solution in an anticipatory contrast paradigm

# Binge eating

- Feature of multiple eating disorders
- Elevated food consumption over short periods of time
- Palatable food are preferred during this events

# Binge eating --> palatable food intake

If binge eating is a behavior related to (hedonic) palatable food intake:

## We know that

- Opioid signaling controls food-intake
- MOR (mu opioid receptor) signaling in Nacc promotes hedonically drive feeding
- MOR agonists --> increases palatability (++licking bout duration)
- MOR activation in NAcc --> increases consumption of preferred flavor (non-caloric)
- Orosensory cues are sufficient for DAMGO-induced hyperfagia

# MOR signaling in NAcc could be related to binge eating

## However, authors proposes a more specific binge-like behavior

- Increased intake of palatable food in short periods of time *AND*
- Selective binge-event (towards preferred food) *AND*
- Hypophagia for non-preferred if preferred food is anticipated

# The specfic binge-like behavior

More accurately models real-life scenario where all kinds of food are available but binged episodes are directed toward palatable (often non-healthy) food options.

# The behavioral model: anticipatory contrast paradigm

- A variable quality or quantity is changed from block to block
- A variable quality in any given block provides complete information of the variable quality in the next block
- Block A: high sucrosose -> BlockB: low sucrose
- Expects learning via temporal association

# Experiment: determine if MOR signaling in NAcc controls this specific binge behavior

# The specific method

- Male Long-Evans rats (300-400 g)
- Bilateral cannulae to NAcc core (n = 28); NAcc shell (n = 56)

## Anticipatory contrast paradigm

- 1 h sessions
- Group A: first 30 min --> 4% sucrose free access water, last 30 min --> 0% sucrose free access water
- Group B: first 30 min --> 4% sucrose free access water, last 30 min --> 20% sucrose free access water

# The specific method

## Drug infusion protocol

- Naltrexone (nonspecific opioid antagonist): {0, 1, 10, 50 micrograms}
- Naltrindole (delta opioid receptor antagonist): {0, 0.5, 5, 10 micrograms}
- Beta-FNA (irreversible MOR antagonist): {0, 0.5, 5, 10 micrograms}
- Injected 10 mins prior to testing

# Results

## Contrast paradigm

- 4% sucrose 4-0 > 4-20
- 4-0 first block > second block
- 4-20 first block < second block

# Results

## Effects of naltrexone: NAcc shell

- Reduced licking in both groups
- Groups x Drug interaction: p < 0.01
	- 4-0 group reduced licking for 4% sucrose
	- 4-20 group did not reduce 4% sucrose consumption; reduced 20% sucrose consumption

# Discussion

- MOR signaling promoted intake of learned preferrences
- Adaptive role to consume the most paltable option
- Nacc shell mediated reinforcing properties of reward
- Signalining: NAcc core != NAcc shell
	- NAcc shell --> direct projection to lateral hypothalamus
- Signalining can be macronutrient specific: NAcc core signaling interruption decreases high-fat intake, while in NAcc core decreases sweet solution intake

# My take

- NAcc MOR signaling controls learned preferrence intake
- Binge eating in the real world equates to a learned preferrence of paltable food over healthy foods
- However, I see no evidence of NAcc MOR signalining controlling learned hypophagia of non-preferred option
- Good model for controlling food properties (and isolating preferrence), but not precisely typical binge model
