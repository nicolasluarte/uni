# Introduction

Uncertainty is inevitable, whether for getting the desired job position or obtaining the food necessary to sustain life. Strategies to cope with uncertainty, thus, are expected. When considering our evolutive history, one of the most critical tasks we faced was obtaining food to survive and reproduce.

In an idyllic environment, the optimal strategy would be to consume all the possible food. However, this is not practical because food sources are dispersed throughout the environment, typically following a 'patchy' distribution [@PMF8ZMN4#Weimerskirch_Gault_Cherel_2005]. This distribution requires an energetic cost to move from one patch to another. Moreover, movement between patches could potentially augment the risk of predation.

The foraging problem is as follows: animals must satisfy energetic demands while searching for food in an uncertain environment, balancing between overeating (thus becoming less mobile) and eating less but increasing the risk of death upon sudden food scarcity [@24GKBPQM#Macleod_Etal_2005; @EI67CZTN#Lima_Dill_1990]. The foraging problem could be the decision-making core of obesity, as is a well-preserved function throughout evolution that finally controls caloric intake.

Understanding the foraging behavior during uncertainty can allow us, in turn, to devise mechanisms underlying pathological weight increases such as seen in obesity. In naturalistic settings, evidence points that food-insecurity and cues associated with uncertain access to food sources predict increases in fat deposit and higher body mass index (BMI) [@HJF7ID5Y#Nettle_Etal_2019; @EER2TNCJ#Nettle_Andrews_Bateson_2017; @A3JT6IHA#Nettle_Etal_2019; @24GKBPQM#Macleod_Etal_2005]. 

# Objectives

## Assess the effects of uncertainty in food-seeking related behavior

### Model how the uncertainty of access to preferred food-choice changes the future intake probability in a two-alternative forced-choice task

### Main hypothesis:
1. Although the preferred option average required work is the same as non-preferred option, the uncertainty condition will increase the probability of choosing a preferred option.
2. Delivery uncertainty should result in similar behavioral changes to hypothesis 1

- n mice will be acclimated to using a lickometer; later on the preference for two non-caloric solutions will be tested using a two-alternative forced-choice task within a fixed ratio (FR) scheme. Briefly, the mice start any given trial by standing on a platform, then lickometers lights are turned on, signaling the trial's start; the animal must perform n licks to obtain the chosen solution; after a solution is delivered, the trial ends.
After the preference is established as the empirical probability, the preferred solution will be subjected to uncertainty regarding the work needed to obtain the solution and the probability of the reward being delivered.

Additional ideas:

1. Both choices are the same (preferred / non-preferred), regret analysis (the increase in responding is dependent/independent on whether the previous trial was rewarded or not)

Notes:
Testing with a preferred option allows us to see the effects of uncertainty in a more realistic scenario that can model typical diet restriction.

## Determine the effects of food-uncertainty in food-regulatory neural mechanisms

### Quantify the effects of prolonged food-uncertainty exposure in feeding-related neuropeptides
Check: [@L2MVQGK9#Lazzarino_Etal_2019]

### Main hypothesis:

1. Orexin expression should increase for the group in the uncertainty condition
2. Breakpoint for sucrose should be higher for the group in the uncertainty condition
 Total intake for standard and palatable chow should be increased in the uncertainty condition group.

- n mice will be acclimated to using an automatic pellet dispenser and separated into two groups(a) one where the delay between pellet delivery is held constant, and (b) one where pellet delay will have a random delay interval.
- Differential mRNA levels will be tested for both groups
- Progressive ratio test will be performed on both groups for the acquisition of sucrose to assess motivation for palatable food
- Using the same automatic pellet dispenser, both groups total intake over a day for palatable pellets will be tested over a day
